		"abstract": "Background\nThe COVID-19 pandemic lead to a massive shutdown of social life in Germany starting in March 2020. Elective medical treatment was substantially reduced but urgent diagnostics and treatment including cancer care should not have been affected.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nWe analyzed the number of oncology admissions to 75 German Helios hospitals during 2 time periods in 2020 and compared the data with the respective periods in 2019. The study included nearly 69,000 admissions in total.\n\nResults\nA highly significant reduction in overall cancer admissions was seen for the early lockdown period from 13 March to 28 April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. After an official communication advising the health system to return to normal practice on 29 April 2020, we again found a highly significant difference in admissions compared to the respective time in the previous year. Subgroup analysis shows a significant impact of age >75 years, high hospital volume, and intermediate or high COVID-19 case volume in the federal states. Gender had no impact on admission numbers. The effects and significance levels were comparable in nearly all different diagnostic subgroups according to the ICD codes.\n\nConclusions\nFor cancer diagnosis and treatment, we found a statistically significant decrease in hospital admissions in the range of 10–20% for both study periods in comparison to the previous year.",

Eine weitere Intention ist es, dem Lesenden eine Checkliste zur Bewertung geplanter Forschungsvorhaben und Artikel bereitzustellen. Zu diesem Zweck hat eine aus Mitgliedern verschiedener Fachgesellschaften zusammengesetzte Expertengruppe seit 2016 insgesamt 7 Leitlinien mit 27 konkreten Empfehlungen erstellt. Die Gute Praxis Datenlinkage beinhaltet die folgenden Leitlinien: (1) Forschungsziele, Fragestellung, Datenquellen und Ressourcen, (2) Dateninfrastruktur und Datenfluss, (3) Datenschutz, (4) Ethik, (5) Schlüsselvariablen und Linkageverfahren, (6) Datenprüfung/Qualitätssicherung sowie (7) Langfristige Datennutzung für noch festzulegende Fragestellungen. Jede Leitlinie wird ausführlich diskutiert. Zukünftige Aktualisierungen werden wissenschaftliche und datenschutzrechtliche Entwicklungen berücksichtigen.",

		"abstract": "AIMS: The Covid-19 pandemic affects care for cardiovascular conditions, but data on heart failure (HF) are scarce. This study aims to analyse HF care and in-hospital outcomes during the pandemic in Germany.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 9452 HF admissions were studied using claims data of 65 Helios hospitals; 1979 in the study period (13 March 30 April 2020) and 4691 and 2782 in two control periods (13 March to 30 April 2019 and 1 January to 12 March 2020). HF admissions declined compared with both control periods by 29-38%. Cardiac resynchronization therapy was implanted in 0.55% during the study period, 0.32% [odds ratio (OR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-4.04, P = 0.27] in the previous year and 0.43% (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.64-2.84, P = 0.43) in the same year control. Intensive care treatment was 6.22% during the study period, 4.49% in the previous year (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.89, P < 0.01), and 5.27% in the same year control (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.96-1.49, P = 0.12). Length of hospital stay was 7.0 ± 5.0 days in the study and 7.8 ± 5.6 (P < 0.01) and 7.3 ± 5.1 days (P = 0.07) in the control periods. In-hospital mortality was 7.0% in the study and 5.5% in both control periods (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: During the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany, HF treatment pathways seem not to be affected, but hospital stay shortened and in-hospital mortality increased. As the pandemic continues, this early signal demands close monitoring and further investigation of potential causes.",

		"abstract": "Aims: Atrial fibrillation (AFib) and atrial flutter (AFlut) are common arrhythmias with increased use of invasive procedures. A steady re-evaluation of relevant safety endpoints is recommended and both quality management and pay-for-performance programs are evolving. Therefore, the aims of this study were (i) to investigate and report overall in-hospital mortality and mortality of invasive arrhythmia-related procedures and (ii) to identify mortality predictors in a German-wide hospital network.\nMethods and results: Administrative data provided by 78 Helios hospitals between 2010 and 2017 were examined using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems- and Operations and Procedures-codes to identify patients with AFib or AFlut as main discharge diagnosis or secondary diagnosis combined with invasive arrhythmia-related interventions. In 161 502 patients, in-hospital mortality was 0.6% with a significant decrease from 0.75% to 0.5% (P < 0.01) during the observational period. In multivariable analysis, age [odds ratio (OR) 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36-3.05; P < 0.01], high centre volume (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50-0.65; P < 0.01), emergency hospital admission (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.38-1.79; P < 0.01), and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI, OR 4.95, 95% CI 4.50-5.44; P < 0.01) were found as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Mortality rates were 0.05% for left atrial catheter ablation (CA, n = 21 744), 0.3% for right atrial CA (n = 9972), and 0.56% for implantation of a left atrial appendage occluder (n = 2309), respectively.\nConclusion: We analysed for the first time in-hospital mortality rates of patients with atrial arrhythmias in a German-wide, multi-centre administrative dataset. This allows feasible, comparable, and up-to-date performance measurement of clinically important endpoints in a real-world setting which may contribute to quality management programs and towards value-based healthcare.",

		"abstract": "In data clustering, the problem of selecting the subset of most relevant features from the data has been an active research topic. Feature selection for clustering is a challenging task due to the absence of class labels for guiding the search for relevant features. Most methods proposed for this goal are focused on numerical data. In this work, we propose an approach for clustering and selecting categorical features simultaneously. We assume that the data originate from a ﬁnite mixture of multinomial distributions and implement an integrated expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm that estimates all the parameters of the model and selects the subset of relevant features simultaneously. The results obtained on synthetic data illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. An application to real data, referred to oﬃcial statistics, shows its usefulness.",

		"abstract": "Recursive partitioning methods have become popular and widely used tools for non-parametric regression and classification in many scientific fields. Especially random forests, that can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex interactions, have been applied successfully in genetics, clinical medicine and bioinformatics within the past few years., High dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only few subjects can be measured due to time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications, and provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions., The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application., Application of the methods is illustrated using freely available implementations in the R system for statistical computing.",

		"abstract": "Background: Despite the expanding use of machine learning (ML) in ﬁelds such as ﬁnance and marketing, its application in the daily practice of clinical medicine is almost non-existent. In this systematic review, we describe the various areas within clinical medicine that have applied the use of ML to improve patient care.\nMethods: A systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines using Medline(R), EBM Reviews, Embase, Psych Info, and Cochrane Databases, focusing on human studies that used ML to directly address a clinical problem. Included studies were published from January 1, 2000 to May 1, 2018 and provided metrics on the performance of the utilized ML tool.\nResults: A total of 1909 unique publications were reviewed, with 378 retrospective articles and 8 prospective articles meeting inclusion criteria. Retrospective publications were found to be increasing in frequency, with 61 % of articles published within the last 4 years. Prospective articles comprised only 2 % of the articles meeting our inclusion criteria. These studies utilized a prospective cohort design with an average sample size of 531.\nConclusion: The majority of literature describing the use of ML in clinical medicine is retrospective in nature and often outlines proof-of-concept approaches to impact patient care. We postulate that identifying and overcoming key translational barriers, including real-time access to clinical data, data security, physician approval of “black box” generated results, and performance evaluation will allow for a fundamental shift in medical practice, where specialized tools will aid the healthcare team in providing better patient care.",

Disease prediction using health data has recently shown a potential application area for these methods. This study ai7ms to identify the key trends among different types of supervised machine learning algorithms, and their performance and usage for disease risk prediction.\n\nMethods\nIn this study, extensive research efforts were made to identify those studies that applied more than one supervised machine learning algorithm on single disease prediction. Two databases (i.e., Scopus and PubMed) were searched for different types of search items. Thus, we selected 48 articles in total for the comparison among variants supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction.\n\nResults\nWe found that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is applied most frequently (in 29 studies) followed by the Naïve Bayes algorithm (in 23 studies). However, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm showed superior accuracy comparatively. Of the 17 studies where it was applied, RF showed the highest accuracy in 9 of them, i.e., 53%. This was followed by SVM which topped in 41% of the studies it was considered.\n\nConclusion\nThis study provides a wide overview of the relative performance of different variants of supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. This important information of relative performance can be used to aid researchers in the selection of an appropriate supervised machine learning algorithm for their studies.",

		"abstract": "Background\nFollowing visible successes on a wide range of predictive tasks, machine learning techniques are attracting substantial interest from medical researchers and clinicians. We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data.\n\nMethods\nWe demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N=683) was randomly split into evaluation (n=456) and validation (n=227) samples., We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment.\n\nResults\nThe trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble.\n\nConclusions\nWe use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12874-019-0681-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite increasing emphasis on the role of clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs) for improving care and reducing costs, evidence to support widespread use is lacking.\nPURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of CDSSs on clinical outcomes, health care processes, workload and efficiency, patient satisfaction, cost, and provider use and implementation.\nDATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science through January 2011.\nSTUDY SELECTION: Investigators independently screened reports to identify randomized trials published in English of electronic CDSSs that were implemented in clinical settings; used by providers to aid decision making at the point of care; and reported clinical, health care process, workload, relationship-centered, economic, or provider use outcomes.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Investigators extracted data about study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and quality.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: 148 randomized, controlled trials were included. A total of 128 (86%) assessed health care process measures, 29 (20%) assessed clinical outcomes, and 22 (15%) measured costs. Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs improved health care process measures related to performing preventive services (n= 25; odds ratio [OR], 1.42 [95% CI, 1.27 to 1.58]), ordering clinical studies (n= 20; OR, 1.72 [CI, 1.47 to 2.00]), and prescribing therapies (n= 46; OR, 1.57 [CI, 1.35 to 1.82]). Few studies measured potential unintended consequences or adverse effects.\nLIMITATIONS: Studies were heterogeneous in interventions, populations, settings, and outcomes. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be excluded.\nCONCLUSION: Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs are effective at improving health care process measures across diverse settings, but evidence for clinical, economic, workload, and efficiency outcomes remains sparse. This review expands knowledge in the field by demonstrating the benefits of CDSSs outside of experienced academic centers.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",

Key advances in structuring and encoding standardized data with an increased availability of data, development of knowledge bases for CDS, and improvement of capabilities to share knowledge artifacts, explosion of methods analyzing and inferring from clinical data, evolution of information technologies and architectures to facilitate the broad application of CDS, improvement of methods to implement CDS and integrate CDS into the clinical workflow, and increasing sophistication of the end-user, all have played a role in improving the effective use of CDS in healthcare delivery.\n\nConclusion\nCDS has evolved dramatically over the past 25 years and will likely evolve just as dramatically or more so over the next 25 years. Increasingly, the clinical encounter between a clinician and a patient will be supported by a wide variety of cognitive aides to support diagnosis, treatment, care-coordination, surveillance and prevention, and health maintenance or wellness.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\nFibrous dysplasia (FD) is a congenital disorder arising from sporadic mutation of the α-subunit of the Gs stimulatory protein. Osseous changes are characterised by the replacement and distortion of normal bone with poorly organised, structurally unsound, fibrous tissue. The disease process may be localised to a single or multiple bones. In McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS), fibrous dysplasia is associated with hyperfunction of endocrine organs and overproduction of melanin in the skin, while Mazabraud syndrome FD is associated with intramuscular myxomas. In radiology, FD is very often automatically associated with the term “ground glass matrix”. However, FD is a complex disease, and knowledge of its unique pathogenesis and course are crucial to understanding imaging findings and potential complications. This article aims to not only summarise the spectrum of radiological findings of osseous and extra-osseous abnormalities associated with FD but also to highlight the pathological base of the disease evolution, corresponding imaging changes and complications based on the disease distribution. We also have provided current recommendations for clinical management and follow-up of patients with FD.\n\nTeaching Points\n• FD is often a part of complex disease, involving not only bone but also multiple other organs., • FD lesions are characterised by age-related histological, radiographical and clinical transformations., • Radiologists play a crucial role in the identification of osseous complications associated with FD., • The craniofacial form of the disease is the most common type of FD and the most difficult form to manage., • Patients with McCune-Albright syndrome may have different extra-skeletal abnormalities, which often require follow-up.",

		"abstract": "Summary\n            Background: Data that needs to be documented for clinical studies has often been acquired and documented in clinical routine. Usually this data is manually transferred to Case Report Forms (CRF) and/or directly into an electronic data capture (EDC) system.\n            Objectives: To enhance the documentation process of a large clinical follow-up study targeting patients admitted for acutely decompensated heart failure by accessing the data created during routine and study visits from a hospital information system (HIS) and by transferring it via a data warehouse (DWH) into the study‘s EDC system.\n            Methods: This project is based on the clinical DWH developed at the University of Würzburg. The DWH was extended by several new data domains including data created by the study team itself. An R user interface was developed for the DWH that allows to access its source data in all its detail, to transform data as comprehensively as possible by R into study-specific variables and to support the creation of data and catalog tables.\n            Results: A data flow was established that starts with labeling patients as study patients within the HIS and proceeds with updating the DWH with this label and further data domains at a daily rate. Several study-specific variables were defined using the implemented R user interface of the DWH. This system was then used to export these variables as data tables ready for import into our EDC system. The data tables were then used to initialize the first 296 patients within the EDC system by pseudonym, visit and data values. Afterwards, these records were filled with clinical data on heart failure, vital parameters and time spent on selected wards.\n            Conclusions: This solution focuses on the comprehensive access and transformation of data for a DWH-EDC system linkage. Using this system in a large clinical study has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for a study with a complex visit schedule.",

		"abstract": "Background  Heart failure is the predominant cause of hospitalization and amongst the leading causes of death in Germany. However, accurate estimates of prevalence and incidence are lacking. Reported figures originating from different information sources are compromised by factors like economic reasons or documentation quality.\nMethods  We implemented a clinical data warehouse that integrates various information sources (structured parameters, plain text, data extracted by natural language processing) and enables reliable approximations to the real number of heart failure patients. Performance of ICD-based diagnosis in detecting heart failure was compared across the years 2000–2015 with (a) advanced definitions based on algorithms that integrate various sources of the hospital information system, and (b) a physician-based reference standard.\nResults  Applying these methods for detecting heart failure in inpatients revealed that relying on ICD codes resulted in a marked underestimation of the true prevalence of heart failure, ranging from 44% in the validation dataset to 55% (single year) and 31% (all years) in the overall analysis. Percentages changed over the years, indicating secular changes in coding practice and efficiency. Performance was markedly improved using search and permutation algorithms from the initial expert-specified query (F1 score of 81%) to the computer-optimized query (F1 score of 86%) or, alternatively, optimizing precision or sensitivity depending on the search objective.\nConclusions  Estimating prevalence of heart failure using ICD codes as the sole data source yielded unreliable results. Diagnostic accuracy was markedly improved using dedicated search algorithms. Our approach may be transferred to other hospital information systems.",

A central focus of the Clinical and Translational Science Award One Health Alliance (COHA) is to integrate efforts across multiple disciplines to better understand shared diseases in animals and people. The ability to combine veterinary and human medical data provides a unique resource to study the interactions and relationships between animals, humans, and the environment. However, to effectively answer these questions, veterinary EHR data must first be prepared in the same way it is now commonly being done in human medicine to enable data mining and development of analytics to facilitate knowledge formation and solutions that advance our understanding of disease processes, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for veterinary patients and their owners. As a first step, COHA member institutions implemented a Common Data Model to standardize EHR data. Herein we present the approach executed within the COHA framework to prepare and optimize veterinary EHRs for data mining and knowledge formation based on the adoption of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics' Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model.",

		"abstract": "Objectives: Electronic health records (EHRs) have increasingly emerged as a powerful source of clinical data that can be leveraged for reuse in research and in modular health apps that integrate into diverse health information technologies. A key challenge to these use cases is representing the knowledge contained within data from different EHR systems in a uniform fashion. Method: We reviewed several recent studies covering the knowledge representation in the common data models for the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) and its Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program, and the United States Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORNet). We also reviewed the Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource standard supporting app-like programs that can be used across multiple EHR and research systems. Results: There has been a recent growth in high-impact efforts to support quality-assured and standardized clinical data sharing across different institutions and EHR systems. We focused on three major efforts as part of a larger landscape moving towards shareable, transportable, and computable clinical data. Conclusion: The growth in approaches to developing common data models to support interoperable knowledge representation portends an increasing availability of high-quality clinical data in support of research. Building on these efforts will allow a future whereby significant portions of the populations in the world may be able to share their data for research.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The development and adoption of health care common data models (CDMs) has addressed some of the logistical challenges of performing research on data generated from disparate health care systems by standardizing data representations and leveraging standardized terminology to express clinical information consistently. However, transforming a data system into a CDM is not a trivial task, and maintaining an operational, enterprise capable CDM that is incrementally updated within a data warehouse is challenging.\nOBJECTIVES: To develop a quality assurance (QA) process and code base to accompany our incremental transformation of the Department of Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse health care database into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to prevent incremental load errors.\nMETHODS: We designed and implemented a multistage QA) approach centered on completeness, value conformance, and relational conformance data-quality elements. For each element we describe key incremental load challenges, our extract, transform, and load (ETL) solution of data to overcome those challenges, and potential impacts of incremental load failure.\nRESULTS: Completeness and value conformance data-quality elements are most affected by incremental changes to the CDW, while updates to source identifiers impact relational conformance. ETL failures surrounding these elements lead to incomplete and inaccurate capture of clinical concepts as well as data fragmentation across patients, providers, and locations.\nCONCLUSION: Development of robust QA processes supporting accurate transformation of OMOP and other CDMs from source data is still in evolution, and opportunities exist to extend the existing QA framework and tools used for incremental ETL QA processes.",

		"abstract": "Background: Contributing health data to national, regional, and local networks or registries requires data stored in local systems with local structures and codes to be extracted, transformed, and loaded into a standard format called a Common Data Model (CDM). These processes called Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) require data partners or contributors to invest in costly technical resources with specialized skills in data models, terminologies, and programming. Given the wide range of tasks, skills, and technologies required to transform data into a CDM, a classification of ETL challenges can help identify needed resources, which in turn may encourage data partners with less-technical capabilities to participate in data-sharing networks.\nMethods: We conducted key-informant interviews with data partner representatives to survey the ETL challenges faced in clinical data research networks (CDRNs) and registries. A list of ETL challenges, organized into six themes was vetted during a one-day workshop with a wide range of network stakeholders including data partners, researchers, and policy experts.\nResults: We identified 24 technical ETL challenges related to the data sharing process. All of these ETL challenges were rated as \"important\" or \"very important\" by workshop participants using a five point Likert scale. Based on these findings, a framework for categorizing ETL challenges according to ETL phases, themes, and levels of data network participation was developed.\nConclusions: Overcoming ETL technical challenges require significant investments in a broad array of information technologies and human resources. Identifying these technical obstacles can inform optimal resource allocation to minimize the barriers and cost of entry for new data partners into extant networks, which in turn can expand data networks' inclusiveness and diversity. This paper offers pertinent information and guiding framework that are relevant for data partners in ascertaining challenges associated with contributing data in data networks.",

		"abstract": "Background\n In 2015, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research initiated a large data integration and data sharing research initiative to improve the reuse of data from patient care and translational research. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model and the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tools could be used as a core element in this initiative for harmonizing the terminologies used as well as facilitating the federation of research analyses across institutions.\n, \nObjective\n To realize an OMOP/OHDSI-based pilot implementation within a consortium of eight German university hospitals, evaluate the applicability to support data harmonization and sharing among them, and identify potential enhancement requirements.\n, \nMethods\n The vocabularies and terminological mapping required for importing the fact data were prepared, and the process for importing the data from the source files was designed. For eight German university hospitals, a virtual machine preconfigured with the OMOP database and the OHDSI tools as well as the jobs to import the data and conduct the analysis was provided. Last, a federated/distributed query to test the approach was executed.\n, \nResults\n While the mapping of ICD-10 German Modification succeeded with a rate of 98.8% of all terms for diagnoses, the procedures could not be mapped and hence an extension to the OMOP standard terminologies had to be made.\n, Overall, the data of 3 million inpatients with approximately 26 million conditions, 21 million procedures, and 23 million observations have been imported., A federated query to identify a cohort of colorectal cancer patients was successfully executed and yielded 16,701 patient cases visualized in a Sunburst plot., \nConclusion\n OMOP/OHDSI is a viable open source solution for data integration in a German research consortium. Once the terminology problems can be solved, researchers can build on an active community for further development.",

HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is emerging as a next generation standards framework for facilitating health care and electronic health records-based data exchange. The objective of the study was to design and assess a consensus-based approach for harmonizing the OHDSI CDM with HL7 FHIR. We leverage a FHIR W5 (Who, What, When, Where, and Why) Classification System for designing the harmonization approaches and assess their utility in achieving the consensus among curators using a standard inter-rater agreement measure. Moderate agreement was achieved for the model-level harmonization (kappa = 0.50) whereas only fair agreement was achieved for the property-level harmonization (kappa = 0.21). FHIR W5 is a useful tool in designing the harmonization approaches between data models and FHIR, and facilitating the consensus achievement.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain detailed clinical data stored in proprietary formats with non-standard codes and structures. Participating in multi-site clinical research networks requires EHR data to be restructured and transformed into a common format and standard terminologies, and optimally linked to other data sources. The expertise and scalable solutions needed to transform data to conform to network requirements are beyond the scope of many health care organizations and there is a need for practical tools that lower the barriers of data contribution to clinical research networks.\nMETHODS: We designed and implemented a health data transformation and loading approach, which we refer to as Dynamic ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) (D-ETL), that automates part of the process through use of scalable, reusable and customizable code, while retaining manual aspects of the process that requires knowledge of complex coding syntax. This approach provides the flexibility required for the ETL of heterogeneous data, variations in semantic expertise, and transparency of transformation logic that are essential to implement ETL conventions across clinical research sharing networks. Processing workflows are directed by the ETL specifications guideline, developed by ETL designers with extensive knowledge of the structure and semantics of health data (i.e., \"health data domain experts\") and target common data model.\nRESULTS: D-ETL was implemented to perform ETL operations that load data from various sources with different database schema structures into the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) common data model. The results showed that ETL rule composition methods and the D-ETL engine offer a scalable solution for health data transformation via automatic query generation to harmonize source datasets.\nCONCLUSIONS: D-ETL supports a flexible and transparent process to transform and load health data into a target data model. This approach offers a solution that lowers technical barriers that prevent data partners from participating in research data networks, and therefore, promotes the advancement of comparative effectiveness research using secondary electronic health data.",

The i2b2 data warehousing and analytics platform is used at over 200 sites worldwide, which uses a flexible ontology-driven approach for data storage. We previously demonstrated this ontology system can drive data reconfiguration, to transform data into new formats without site-specific programming. We previously implemented this on our 12-site Accessible Research Commons for Health (ARCH) network to transform i2b2 into the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network model.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we leverage our investment in i2b2 high-performance transformations to support the AOU OMOP data pipeline. Because the ARCH ontology has gained widespread national interest (through the Accrual to Clinical Trials network, other PCORnet networks, and the Nebraska Lexicon), we leveraged sites' existing investments into this standard ontology. We developed an i2b2-to-OMOP transformation, driven by the ARCH-OMOP ontology and the OMOP concept mapping dictionary. We demonstrated and validated our approach in the AOU New England HPO (NEHPO). First, we transformed into OMOP a fake patient dataset in i2b2 and verified through AOU tools that the data was structurally compliant with OMOP. We then transformed a subset of data in the Partners Healthcare data warehouse into OMOP. We developed a checklist of assessments to ensure the transformed data had self-integrity (e.g., the distributions have an expected shape and required fields are populated), using OMOP's visual Achilles data quality tool. This i2b2-to-OMOP transformation is being used to send NEHPO production data to AOU. It is open-source and ready for use by other research projects.",

This case-matched control study compared patient-reported outcome and satisfaction data following hip resurfacing and total hip arthroplasty. Thirty-three consecutive patients selected for hip resurfacing were compared with 99 patients undergoing cemented total hip replacement (THR), matched for age, sex and pathology. Participants completed a Short-Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12) and Oxford Hip Score questionnaire preoperatively and 6 months post operatively with an additional patient satisfaction questionnaire. There was no difference in length of hospital stay. While both groups reported improved outcome scores, multivariate regression analysis did not demonstrate any significant benefit for one group over the other. Both groups reported high levels of satisfaction, which tended to be better in patients undergoing hip resurfacing.",

No HXLPE patient required revision for wear related concerns, compared to 5 CPE patients with revision for aseptic loosening or impending radiographic failure (0% vs 5.9%, p = 0.02). HXLPE is associated with reduced wear among young, active THA patients without increased risk of early mechanical failure.",

		"abstract": "Polyethylene wear and the subsequent development of periprosthetic osteolysis are the major factors limiting the longevity of total hip arthroplasties. A minority eventually loosen, but no clinically applicable system exists for accurate early prediction of failure. The relationship between acetabular wear and the development of loosening, osteolysis, and revision was investigated in 235 Charnley low friction arthroplasties. The average age of the patient at surgery was 31.7 years (range, 17-39 years), and the duration of followup averaged 234 months (19.5 years; range, 74-364 months). Total wear averaged 2.1 mm (range, 0-7.2 mm), and the average wear rate was 0.11 mm per year (range, 0-0.55 mm/year), with the wear rate of revised components being twice that of surviving ones (0.19 mm/year versus 0.09 mm/year). The prevalence of osteolysis (33 hips, 14%) and of acetabular and femoral component loosening and revision rose significantly with increasing wear. Osteolysis also was associated significantly with femoral component loosening and revision, but the presence of calcar changes was not (90 hips, 38%). Twenty-five year survivorship exceeded 90% for arthroplasties with a wear rate less than 0.1 mm per year, but 20-year survivorship of acetabular components with a rate greater than 0.2 mm per year was below 30%, and none survived 25 years. For every additional millimeter of wear, the risk of acetabular revision in any one year increased by 45% and for the femur increased by 32%.",

Following independent validation, FRAX has been incorporated into more than 80 guidelines worldwide. However, the application of FRAX in guidelines has been heterogeneous with the adoption of several different approaches to setting intervention thresholds. The relationship between FRAX and efficacy of intervention has been explored and is expected to influence treatment guidelines in the future.

		"abstract": "Osteoporosis constitutes a major public health problem, through its association with age-related fractures, particularly of the hip, vertebrae, distal forearm and humerus. Substantial geographic variation has been noted in the incidence of osteoporotic fractures worldwide, with Western populations (North America, Europe and Oceania), reporting increases in hip fracture throughout the second half of the 20th century, with a stabilisation or decline in the last two decades. In developing populations however, particularly in Asia, the rates of osteoporotic fracture appears to be increasing. The massive global burden consequent to osteoporosis means that fracture risk assessment should be a high priority among health measures considered by policy makers. The WHO operational definition of osteoporosis, based on a measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), has been used globally since the mid-1990s. However, although this definition identifies those at greatest individual risk of fracture, in the population overall a greater total number of fractures occur in individuals with BMD values above the threshold for osteoporosis diagnosis. A number of web-based tools to enable the inclusion of clinical risk factors, with or without BMD, in fracture prediction algorithms have been developed to improve the identification of individuals at high fracture risk, the most commonly used globally being FRAX®. Access to DXA, osteoporosis risk assessment, case finding and treatment varies worldwide, but despite such advances studies indicate that a minority of men and women at high fracture risk receive treatment. Importantly, research is ongoing to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis case finding and risk assessment strategies worldwide. The huge burden caused by osteoporosis related fractures to individuals, healthcare systems and societies should provide a clear impetus for the progression of such approaches.",

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is still no general consensus about the management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Recommendations depend on type of fracture, grade of instability, bone quality, and general conditions of the patient. Spontaneous fractures may be considered to be treated different compared to cases with high-velocity trauma.\nMETHODS: According to the DVO, patients without trauma should first be treated conservatively. However, there is no more strict time protocol of 3 or 6 week conservative treatment before operations may be indicated. Surgical criteria are not yet distinctly defined. For highly unstable fractures (type B and C according to the AO Spine Classification), posterior instrumentation with cement augmented screws and as long construct, respectively, is adequate. Current literature has been analysed for diagnostic and therapeutic protocols.\nRESULTS: There is no clear operative concept for burst fractures and classic osteoporotic fractures with dynamic ongoing sintering. Percutaneous vertebral augmentation showed to prevent the fractures from ongoing kyphotic deformity and the patients from painful immobilization. Indications and results of classical vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been discussed intensively in the literature. Further development included special injection techniques, cements with different viscosities and stenting systems to reach more stable constructs and avoid typical complications, such as cement extrusion.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review reports upon indications and limitations of percutaneous vertebral augmentation and the potential development of classifications and therapeutic algorithms.",

		"abstract": "Osteoporosis is a burgeoning clinical problem that is characterized by decreased bone strength and density. It predisposes patients to fragility fractures and debilitating spine deformities. Several complications are associated with spine surgery in patients with osteoporosis, and there is currently no treatment algorithm to guide the spine surgeon. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment of patients with osteoporosis and spine deformity or fracture is encouraged, and preoperative planning is crucial for successful surgical outcomes. Several surgical techniques have been developed to treat osteoporosis-related deformities, including posterior instrumentation with fusion. However, achieving fixation and fusion in these patients can be difficult secondary to poor bone stock. Augmentation methods to improve pedicle screw fixation have evolved, including instrumentation at multiple levels, bioactive cement augmentation, and fenestrated or expandable pedicle screws, but their impact on clinical outcomes remains unknown. Management of osteoporosis in patients undergoing spine surgery is challenging, but with appropriate patient selection, medical optimization, and surgical techniques, these patients can experience pain relief, deformity correction, and improved function.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Osteoporosis is a major health-care problem that is increasing in magnitude with the aging population. Such patients are more prone to develop painful and debilitating spinal deformities but are difficult to treat. Currently, no definitive treatment algorithm has been established.\nPURPOSE: To review the failure modes of instrumentation and novel surgical treatments of spinal deformities in patients with osteoporosis with the goal of improving surgical care.\nSTUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Review article.\nMETHODS: We systematically searched PubMed for articles regarding instrumentation failure modes and surgical treatments of spinal deformities in patients with osteoporosis and summarized current treatment options.\nRESULTS: The surgical treatment options are severely limited because of the tendency for instrument failure secondary to pullout and subsidence, leading to revision procedures; multiple levels and multiple fixation points are recommended to minimize the risk. The literature supports the use of vertebroplasty in conjunction with pedicle screw-based instrumentation for treating more severe spinal deformities. Other techniques and modifications with evidence of reduced failure risk are bicortical screws, hydroxyapatite coatings, double screws, and expandable screws. Anterior approaches may provide another avenue of treatment, but only a few studies have been conducted on these implants in patients with osteoporosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Spinal deformities in patients with osteoporosis are difficult to treat because of their debilitating and progressive nature. Novel surgical approaches and instruments have been designed to decrease construct failures in this patient population by reducing implant pullout, subsidence, and incidence of revision surgery. The success of these techniques depends on integrating biomaterial, biologic, and biomechanical aspects with clinical considerations. Synthesizing this myriad of aspects will lead to improved treatment options for patients with osteoporosis who are suffering from spinal deformities.",

This article explains how to diagnose such a detected lesion. Primarily, the growth rate is analyzed according to the Lodwick classification to differentiate a benign from a malignant lesion. With that, the lesser experienced clinician has solved the most important task in the diagnostic process. Further steps include analysis of the tumor matrix and the location within the tumor-bearing bone to make a specific diagnosis. Finally, the patient’s age is included as a further parameter. With an optimized combination of the different parameters, the expert achieves a correct specific diagnosis in about 80% of cases.",

		"abstract": "Bony metastases are a frequent problem in elderly patients affected by cancer, and those with bony metastases involve the spine in approx. 50%. The most frequent spinal metastases (60%) are from breast, lung, or prostate cancer. The chance that an elderly patient (60–79 years old) is affected by bony metastases is four times higher in men and three times higher in women than a middle-aged patient (40–59 years old). Since the medical treatment with all the adjuvant treatment options prolong the survival of this particular patient group, the spinal metastases may become a mechanical issue, thus requesting surgical treatment. Different classification systems have been proposed to rationalize surgical indications, some concentrating solely on the local spinal tumor involvement and some including the overall clinical situation. Since most of the surgical options are of palliative character, it is more important to base the decision on an overall clinical classification including the different treatment modalities—irradiation, chemotherapy, steroids, bisphosphonates, and surgery—to make a shared decision. In case surgery is indicated—neural compression, pathological fracture, instability, and progressive deformity, nursing reasons—the most straightforward procedures should be chosen, which may not need an intensive care unit stay. In the thoracolumbar spine a posterior decompression and posterolateral vertebral body resection through a posterior approach only, with a concomitant reconstruction and stabilization, has shown to work sufficiently well. In the middle and lower cervical spine the anterior approach with anterior decompression and anterior column reconstruction is most effective and has a low morbidity, whereas the occipitocervical junction can generally be treated by posterior resection and stabilization. The outcome should be determined by the survival time in an ambulatory, independent status, where pain is controlled, and the patient is not hospitalized. Surgical management shows the greatest improvement in pain reduction, but also in other domains of quality of life. Since prospective randomized studies comparing different treatment modalities for spinal metastases including surgery are not available and are ethically difficult to achieve, each case remains an interdisciplinary, shared decision making process for what is considered best for a patient or elderly patient. However, whenever surgery is an option, it should be planned before irradiation since surgery after irradiation has a significant higher complication rate.",

		"abstract": "Chondrosarcoma is the third most common primary malignant bone tumor. Currently, outcomes are based largely on a histologic grading scale described by the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Bone Tumors (2002). This classification scheme possesses evident utility in the evaluation and management of higher grade tumors, but it is often unable to distinguish enchondromas from low-grade chondrosarcomas. This is problematic when low-grade lesions that are histologically similar to enchondromas demonstrate aggressive imaging features. Because histologic classification alone often belies the clinical significance of chondroid lesions, it is also important to consider radiologic staging as part of the clinical decision making process. This article focuses on medical decision support considerations relevant when confronted with this challenging subset of chondroid tumors, particularly differentiating the benign enchondroma from its notorious relative, the low-grade chondrosarcoma. In doing so, we present a review of the salient imaging features and discuss key differentiating characteristics.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\nMetastases are the most common malignancies involving bone; breast, prostate, lung and thyroid are the main sites of primary cancer. However, up to 30 % of patients present with bone metastases of unknown origin, where the site of the primary neoplasm cannot be identified at the time of diagnosis despite a thorough history, physical examination, appropriate laboratory testing and modern imaging technology (CT, MRI, PET). Sometimes only extensive histopathological investigations on bone specimens from biopsy can suggest the primary malignancy. At other times, a bone lesion can have such a highly undifferentiated histological appearance that a precise pathological classification on routine hematoxylin–eosin-stained section is not possible. The authors reviewed the relevant literature in an attempt to investigate the epidemiology of the histological primaries finally identified in patients with bone metastases from occult cancer, and a strategy of management and treatment of bone metastases from occult carcinomas is suggested. Lung, liver, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract are common sites for primary occult tumors. Adenocarcinoma is the main histological type, accounting for 70 % of all cases, while undifferentiated cancer accounts for 20 %. Over the past 30 years, lung cancer is the main causative occult primary for bone metastases and has a poor prognosis with an average survival of 4–8 months. Most relevant literature focuses on the need for standardized diagnostic workup, as surgery for bone lesions should be aggressive only when they are solitary and/or the occult primaries have a good prognosis; in these cases, identification of the primary tumor may be important and warrants special diagnostic efforts. However, in most cases, the primary site remains unknown, even after autopsy. Thus, orthopedic surgery has a mainly palliative role in preventing or stabilizing pathological fractures, relieving pain and facilitating the care of the patient in an attempt to provide the most appropriate therapy for the primary tumor as soon as possible.\n\nLevel of evidence\n5",

Clinicians who treat chondrosarcoma patients must determine the grade of the tumor, and must ascertain the likelihood of metastasis. Acral lesions are unlikely to metastasize, regardless of grade, whereas axial, or more proximal lesions are much more likely to metastasize than tumors found in the distal extremities with equivalent histology. Chondrosarcoma is resistant to both chemotherapy and radiation, making wide local excision the only treatment. Local recurrence is frequently seen after intralesional excision, thus wide local excision is sometimes employed despite significant morbidity, even in low-grade lesions. Chondrosarcoma is difficult to treat. The surgeon must balance the risk of significant morbidity with the ability to minimize the chance of local recurrence and maximize the likelihood of long-term survival.",

X-ray imaging and CT scans enable the evaluation of bone destruction, periosteal reaction, sclerotic changes in lesions, condition of cortical bone, and ossification. MRI enables the assessment of tissue characteristics, tumor extent, and the reactive areas.

		"abstract": "A total of 915 subjects with lumbar spine disease of the multicenter case–control study EPILIFT were clinically described in detail. Of the 915 subjects, 43% had a motor or sensomotor lumbar spine syndrome, 38% a sensitive lumbar spine syndrome, and 19% a local lumbar spine syndrome. The arithmetic mean (± standard deviation) for the pain intensity on a visual scale (range 1–10) was 7.4±1.9, which demonstrates the relatively high level of pain experienced by the subjects. Also, the Oswestry score is compatible with high limitations in patient’s everyday life. In 96.0% of the 915 EPILIFT subjects, the radiolo­ gical findings showed disc-related damage in at least one segment either in the form of disc herniation or disc narrowing (chondrosis) of the lower lumbar spine in segment L4/L5 and/or L5/S1. In only 4.0% of the cases was the upper and/or the middle part of the lumbar spine (segment L1/L2 – L3/L4) damaged. A nearly identical distribution of the localization of the radiologically diagnosed disc damage was found in 87 EPILIFT  cases with a total dose according to the Mainz–Dortmund dose (MDD) model of at least 25 MNh in men or 17 MNh in women as well as in the 228 cases with a total dose of at least 12.5 MNh according to the BSG ruling from 30 October 2007 (No. B 2 U 4/06 R).",

		"abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: This was a clinical retrospective study.\nOBJECTIVES: This retrospective study aimed to investigate the incidence of new vertebral compression fractures (NVCFs) and analyze the risk factors that influence the secondary fractures in adjacent and nonadjacent levels after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and conservative treatment (CT).\nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PVP is an effective procedure to alleviate the pain caused by osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. NVCFs have been noted as a potential late sequela of the procedure. However, it remains unclear whether NVCFs are due to this augmentation or simply are the result of the natural progression of osteoporosis.\nMETHODS: A total of 290 patients who had undergone PVP and 270 patients who had undergone CT during the last 4 years were examined. They were followed-up on a monthly basis by telephone for >2 years. They were divided into 2 groups: NVCFs and non-NVCFs. The groups were statistically compared in terms of age, sex, body mass index, initial fracture levels, bone mineral density (BMD) score of the spine, original fracture levels, and new fracture levels.\nRESULTS: After a mean follow-up of at least 24 months (range, 24-78 mo), 42 NVCFs occurred in 37 of 290 patients after PVP and 33 NVCFs in 30 of 270 patients after CT. Only BMD was significantly different between the groups. Lower BMD was a significant predictive factor for NVCFs.\nCONCLUSIONS: PVP did not increase the incidence of NVCFs, especially those adjacent to the treated vertebrae, following augmentation with PVP compared with CT. The most important risk factor for NVCFs was osteoporosis.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

		"abstract": "The assessment of cervical spine injuries is not a problem – provided full evidence of primary physical damage can be ensured. MRI examinations of the cervical spine carried out soon after the accident provide the best evidence. The assessment is more difficult if only clinical abnormalities are documented by the doctors after the accident in the diagnosis of cervical spine distortion, as functional results of this type are not specific and are also common in the general population. The legal rules of evidence must be taken into account in the summary assessment of the consequences of cervical spine injuries. Testing schemes are available which allow structured assessment of cervical spine injuries and help to avoid incorrect assessments.",

		"abstract": "It is difficult to find medical evidence of a correlation between a lumbar disk disease and trauma. One should consider whether the individual degeneration of lumbar disks or the trauma lead to the typical complaints. Disk disease in the population are very common.Therefore the relevance of the individual affection before trauma has to be considered. Spinal trauma with its sudden, incidental onset needs to be differentiated from purposeful and conscious movements. An intervertebral disk disease can be classified as accident related only in cases involving adequate trauma, with no previous complains, and a sudden onset of pain.",

		"abstract": "Outcome evaluations of lower extremity joint reconstructions should include an assessment of patient activity. In vivo wear assessments of total joint prostheses should be based on a measure of use, not time in situ or a proxy such as age or gender; however, clinicians lack a simple method to reliably assess the activity of patients with joint replacement. The modern pedometer can be a satisfactory means of quantifying the use of lower extremity joints. The pedometer, however, requires special effort on the part of the physician or evaluator and the patient. Therefore, we compared the quantitative assessment of walking activity of 100 total joint replacement patients, as measured with a pedometer, to the UCLA activity score and a simple visual analog scale that can easily be employed during a routine office evaluation. Both the UCLA activity rating (P = .002) and the visual analog scale rating of the investigator (P = .00001) had a strong correlation with the average steps per day as recorded by the pedometer. There was, however, up to a 15-fold difference in the average steps per day for individual patients with the same UCLA score. The visual analog scale as rated by the patients of their own activity did not have as strong a correlation with the pedometer data (P = .08) as did patient age (P = .049). For practical reasons, the pedometer is probably best reserved for the evaluation of extreme cases of activity (or inactivity). This study indicates that both the UCLA activity rating and the investigator visual analog scale are valid for routine activity assessment in a clinical setting. Adjustments of the UCLA activity score for the frequency and intensity of activity, as can be done with the investigator visual analog scale, increase the accuracy of the activity rating.",

		"abstract": "We have developed a novel method of calculating the radiological magnification of the hip using two separate radio-opaque markers. We recruited 74 patients undergoing radiological assessment following total hip replacement. Both the new double marker and a conventional single marker were used by the radiographer at the time of x-ray. The predicted magnification according to each marker was calculated, as was the true radiological magnification of the components. The correlation between true and predicted magnification was good using the double marker (r = 0.90, n = 74, p < 0.001), but only moderate for the single marker (r = 0.50, n = 63, p < 0.001). The median error was significantly less for the double marker than for the single (1.1% vs 4.8%, p < 0.001). The double marker method demonstrated excellent validity (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.89), in contrast to the single marker (0.32). The double marker method appears to be superior to the single marker method when used in the clinical environment.",

		"abstract": "Conservative hip implants preserve healthy bone for revision surgeries and improve physiological loading; however, they have few supporting biomechanical data. This thesis determined the 3D orientation of a straight short stem hip implant within the proximal femur that would yield a stress distribution most similar to an intact femur. Synthetic femurs were implanted with a stem in one of seven maximum angles or positions and axially loaded, with resultant strain values used to validate a finite element model. Design of experiments was used to analyze the range of potential implant orientations under three gait cycle loading conditions. A global optimal orientation of 9.14 valgus, 2.49 anteversion, 0.48mm posterior position, and 0.23mm inferior position yielded optimal stress distributions across the range of the gait cycle. Orthopaedic surgeons should therefore implant straight short stem hip implants in valgus up to 10 with an otherwise neutral position and version for maximal physiological loading.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: A periprosthetic femoral fracture after total hip arthroplasty is a serious but uncommon complication, and therefore difficult to analyze clinically in scientifically and statistically valid study samples. With the aim of preventing these fractures the purpose of this study was to investigate potential risk factors associated with cementless hip arthroplasty in a standardized laboratory setup. Additionally, we aimed to clarify if the treatment with a cementless hip stem is fraught with higher risk of periprosthetic fracture for older patients compared to younger patients.\nMATERIAL/METHODS: A biomechanical setup was developed to provide analysis on sixteen femoral specimens of different age. A cementless hip stem was implanted into the specimens and loads - representing hip contact forces - were applied under standardized conditions until fracture occurred. The femurs were divided into two age groups (<70 and >or=77 years of age).\nRESULTS: The elderly specimens fractured at significantly lower maximum forces (<70: Fmax=5,308N; >or=77: Fmax=2,519N; p<0.01). Maximum fracture loads were found to correlate strongly with age (p=0.01), BMD (e.g. for the Ward's triangle: p<0.01) and BMI (p=0.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced age treated with cementless hip stems the risk of suffering a periprosthetic fracture is significantly higher. It increases in patients with an age of 80 years or older, a Ward's triangle BMD below 0.500 g/cm2 and a BMI >33 kg/m2. Whereas one single factor must not be viewed as an exclusion criterion for a cementless hip stem treatment, cumulation of these factors should alert the orthopaedic surgeon.",

		"abstract": "Background\nSeveral mechanical derangements reportedly contribute to the development of noninflammatory arthritis of the hip. Diagnosis of these derangements involves the use of specific radiographic measures (eg, alpha angle, lateral center edge angle, cross-over sign). The reliability of some of these measures is not known, whereas others have not been confirmed.\n\nQuestions/purposes\nWe examined the reproducibility of 20 radiographic parameters of the hip used in clinical practice.\n\nMethods\nTwenty radiographic parameters on standardized digital AP and cross-table lateral radiographs were evaluated by two observers on two different occasions. The parameters were evaluated from the standpoint of reproducibility (reliability and agreement). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), kappa coefficient, and standard error of measurement were calculated. The minimal detectable change was calculated where possible.\n\nResults\nInterrater reliability ranged from 0.45 to 0.90 for ICC depending on the measure. Intrarater reliability ranged from 0.55 to 0.99. Measurements that could be measured directly (femoral head diameter) were more reliable than measurements requiring estimation on the part of the observer (Tönnis angle, neck-shaft angle). Categorical parameters had interrater and intrarater reliability kappa values greater than 0.90 for all parameters measured. Agreement between repeated measurements, as given by the minimal detectable change, showed many parameters with low absolute reliability have clinical use in the context of the large changes seen in clinical practice.\n\nConclusion\nRadiographic hip measures show clinical utility when evaluated from the perspective of agreement and reliability.\n\nClinical Relevance\nAll measures investigated show clinical utility when evaluated from the perspective of reliability and agreement.\n\nLevel of Evidence\n Level III, diagnostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",

		"abstract": "To improve the longevity of endoprostheses, the main goal is to reduce wear. Polyethylene together with metal or ceramic is currently the most frequently used combination. Their clinical success is well documented in the literature. Many attempts to improve polyethylene in the past have failed. Materials successful in the laboratory have failed in clinical use. The most recent competitors of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) are the highly cross-linked polyethylenes (HCLPE) and the hard-on-hard couplings such as metal-on-metal or ceramic-on-ceramic. Advantages and downsides regarding particle generation and higher standards of precision in positioning the components are discussed.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this review is to examine alternative bearings used in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and discuss the specific tribologic needs of the \"New Orthopaedic Patient\". As orthopaedic patients today are younger and more active, there is a clear need for hip joint implants and articulations minimising the amount of wear and guarantying better stability. Recent modern developments in tribology with highly cross-linked polyethylenes and hard-on-hard bearings allow the safe and effective use of larger diameter articulations in THA.",

		"abstract": "In a series of 300 total hip replacements, nine (3 per cent) dislocated. Precise measurements of the orientation of the acetabular cup were made and it was found that anterior dislocations were associated with increased acetabular-component anteversion. There was no significant correlation between cup-orientation angle and posterior dislocation. The dislocation rate for cup orientation with anteversion of 15 +/- 10 degrees and lateral opening of 40 +/- 10 degrees was 1.5 per cent, while outside this \"safe\" range the dislocation rate was 6.1 per cent. Other factors that were documented include time after surgery (with the greatest risk in the first thirty days) and surgical history (with a greater risk in hips that have had prior surgery).",

		"abstract": "Neural networks have been known for a long time as a tool for different types of classification, but only just in the last decade they have showed their entire power. Along with appearing of hardware that is capable to support demanding matrix operations and parallel algorithms, the neural network, as a universal function approximation framework, turns out to be the most successful classification method widely used in all fields of science. On the other side, multifractal (MF) approach is an efficient way for quantitative description of complex structures [1] such as metastatic carcinoma, which recommends this method as an accurate tool for medical diagnostics. The only part that is missing is classification method. The goal of this research is to describe and apply a feed-forward neural network as an auxiliary diagnostic method for classification of multifractal parameters in order to determine primary cancer.",

		"abstract": "To assess the efficiency of plain radiographs for the detection of primary and potentially malignant bone tumors a retrospective study in 70 patients with histologically proven bone sarcomas was performed. Plain radiographs were the first imaging modality in most cases and for many patients the basic step leading to further diagnostic investigations. With young patients suffering from bone pain imaging work-up was obtained immediately, whereas older patients showed significant delay until radiographs were performed. The findings of this study suggest that radiography is an effective tool for the diagnosis of primary and potentially malignant bone tumors and that physicians should think of bone tumors also when patients beyond the adolescence have focal bone pain.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Some of the risks with open biopsy can be avoided by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The diagnostic contribution of radiologic findings has not been systematically studied.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the validity of combined radiology and fine-needle aspiration cytology for the diagnosis of bone lesions in a consecutive series of 370 patients. The treatment diagnosis was based solely on radiology and cytology in 234 cases, whereas in 136 cases histopathology was also applied.\nRESULTS: Comparison of radiology and cytology showed diagnostic compliance in 256 cases (69%) and non-compliance in 101 (28%). 13 (3%) cases failed to yield diagnostic material for cytology. Among the 256 compliant cases, the diagnostic error rate was 1% (2 were falsely benign), whereas the corresponding rate was 17% among the 101 non-compliant cases. In the latter group, 36 cases yielded only normal cells at aspiration, out of which 20 proved to have a neoplastic lesion (8 metastases, 12 benign). The overall sensitivity of cytology alone in recognizing malignancy was 90%. The specificity was 95%. Given a malignant or benign diagnosis, the positive predictive value was 97% and the negative predictive value was 84%.\nINTERPRETATION: Our study suggests that a simple approach based on conventional radiography and fine-needle aspiration cytology offers a valid means of diagnosing bone lesions. Provided there is compliance between radiology and cytology, the risk of false diagnosis is around 1%.",

		"abstract": "Primary bone tumours are rare but account for a significant proportion of cancers occurring in childhood and adolescence. Malignant bone tumours need to be distinguished not only from their benign counterparts but also from tumour-like lesions, many of which are developmental or reactive in nature and are found commonly in the paediatric population. Taking note of the age of the patient and the site of the lesion within bone (aided by several imaging techniques including plain radiographs, ultrasound, computed tomography, bone scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging) is essential for pathological diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, molecular analysis and other techniques are now powerful diagnostic tools in bone pathology. This review aims to provide an approach to the radiological and pathological diagnosis of paediatric bone tumours. It also provides a brief overview of some of the more common bone tumours and tumour-like lesions, both benign and malignant, which occur in childhood and adolescence.",

		"abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is rapidly entering the radiology mainstream. It has already become a part of the routine clinical work for the detection of breast cancer with mammograms. The computer output is used as a \"second opinion\" in assisting radiologists' image interpretations. The computer algorithm generally consists of several steps that may include image processing, image feature analysis, and data classification via the use of tools such as artificial neural networks (ANN). In this article, we will explore these and other current processes that have come to be referred to as \"artificial intelligence.\" One element of CAD, temporal subtraction, has been applied for enhancing interval changes and for suppressing unchanged structures (eg, normal structures) between 2 successive radiologic images. To reduce misregistration artifacts on the temporal subtraction images, a nonlinear image warping technique for matching the previous image to the current one has been developed. Development of the temporal subtraction method originated with chest radiographs, with the method subsequently being applied to chest computed tomography (CT) and nuclear medicine bone scans. The usefulness of the temporal subtraction method for bone scans was demonstrated by an observer study in which reading times and diagnostic accuracy improved significantly. An additional prospective clinical study verified that the temporal subtraction image could be used as a \"second opinion\" by radiologists with negligible detrimental effects. ANN was first used in 1990 for computerized differential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases in CAD. Since then, ANN has been widely used in CAD schemes for the detection and diagnosis of various diseases in different imaging modalities, including the differential diagnosis of lung nodules and interstitial lung diseases in chest radiography, CT, and position emission tomography/CT. It is likely that CAD will be integrated into picture archiving and communication systems and will become a standard of care for diagnostic examinations in daily clinical work.",

Radiography is typically used for first-line imaging. If necessary, it is followed by CT or MRI for evaluation and characterization of surface bone tumors.

However, so far computer-aided diagnosis has not become important in the clinical routine or in the field of radiology. This paper describes the hitherto existing proposals for expert systems to evaluate focal bone lesions and presents a new concept. The basic ideas of this program are: (1) a PC-based interactive dialogue along on the basis of a defined questionnaire; (2) the use of certainty factors to handle uncertainty and vagueness in evaluating the different radiological findings and their correlation with diagnoses; (3) the link between visual information and the questionnaire. The aims of such expert systems are (a) a complete and systematic analysis of the films, (b) independency of association with previously diagnosed cases in reporting the films, (c) the procurement and use of radiological descriptive terms, and (d) aid in the radiological evaluation of focal bone lesions.",

		"abstract": "PurposeIn the diagnostic process of primary bone tumors, patient age, tumor localization and to a lesser extent sex affect the differential diagnosis. We therefore aim to develop a pretest probability calculator for primary malignant bone tumors based on population data taking these variables into account.MethodsWe access the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute, 2015 release) database and analyze data of all primary malignant bone tumors diagnosed between 1973 and 2012. We record age at diagnosis, tumor localization according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-O-3) and sex. We take relative probability of the single tumor entity as a surrogate parameter for unadjusted pretest probability. We build a probabilistic (naïve Bayes) classifier to calculate pretest probabilities adjusted for age, tumor localization and sex.ResultsWe analyze data from 12,931 patients (647 chondroblastic osteosarcomas, 3659 chondrosarcomas, 1080 chordomas, 185 dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas, 2006 Ewing’s sarcomas, 281 fibroblastic osteosarcomas, 129 fibrosarcomas, 291 fibrous malignant histiocytomas, 289 malignant giant cell tumors, 238 myxoid chondrosarcomas, 3730 osteosarcomas, 252 parosteal osteosarcomas, 144 telangiectatic osteosarcomas). We make our probability calculator accessible at http://ebm-radiology.com/bayesbone/index.html. We provide exhaustive tables for age and localization data. Results from tenfold cross-validation show that in 79.8 % of cases the pretest probability is correctly raised.ConclusionsOur approach employs population data to calculate relative pretest probabilities for primary malignant bone tumors. The calculator is not diagnostic in nature. However, resulting probabilities might serve as an initial evaluation of probabilities of tumors on the differential diagnosis list.",

		"abstract": "Background: The majority of current medical CBIR systems perform retrieval based only on “imaging signatures” generated by extracting pixel-level quantitative features, and only rarely has a feedback mechanism been incorporated to improve retrieval performance. In addition, current medical CBIR approaches do not routinely incorporate semantic terms that model the user’s high-level expectations, and this can limit CBIR performance.\nMethod: We propose a retrieval framework that exploits a hybrid feature space (HFS) that is built by integrating low-level image features and high-level semantic terms, through rounds of relevance feedback (RF) and performs similarity-based retrieval to support semi-automatic image interpretation. The novelty of the proposed system is that it can impute the semantic features of the query image by reformulating the query vector representation in the HFS via user feedback. We implemented our framework as a prototype that performs the retrieval over a database of 811 radiographic images that contains 69 unique types of bone tumors.\nResults: We evaluated the system performance by conducting independent reading sessions with two subspecialist musculoskeletal radiologists. For the test set, the proposed retrieval system at fourth RF iteration of the sessions conducted with both the radiologists achieved mean average precision (MAP) value ∼0.90 where the initial MAP with baseline CBIR was 0.20. In addition, we also achieved high prediction accuracy (> 0.8) for the majority of the semantic features automatically predicted by the system.\nConclusion: Our proposed framework addresses some limitations of existing CBIR systems by incorporating user feedback and simultaneously predicting the semantic features of the query image. This obviates the need for the user to provide those terms and makes CBIR search more eﬃcient for inexperience users/trainees. Encouraging results achieved in the current study highlight possible new directions in radiological image interpretation employing semantic CBIR combined with relevance feedback of visual similarity.",

		"abstract": "This report describes the process of radiomics, its challenges, and its potential power to facilitate better clinical decision making, particularly in the care of patients with cancer., In the past decade, the field of medical image analysis has grown exponentially, with an increased number of pattern recognition tools and an increase in data set sizes. These advances have facilitated the development of processes for high-throughput extraction of quantitative features that result in the conversion of images into mineable data and the subsequent analysis of these data for decision support; this practice is termed radiomics. This is in contrast to the traditional practice of treating medical images as pictures intended solely for visual interpretation. Radiomic data contain first-, second-, and higher-order statistics. These data are combined with other patient data and are mined with sophisticated bioinformatics tools to develop models that may potentially improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy. Because radiomics analyses are intended to be conducted with standard of care images, it is conceivable that conversion of digital images to mineable data will eventually become routine practice. This report describes the process of radiomics, its challenges, and its potential power to facilitate better clinical decision making, particularly in the care of patients with cancer.",

		"abstract": "Because many bone tumors have a variety of appearances and are uncommon, few radiologists develop sufficient expertise to guide optimal management. Bayesian inference can guide decision-making by computing probabilities of multiple diagnoses to generate a differential. We built and validated a naïve Bayes machine (NBM) that processes 18 demographic and radiographic features. We reviewed over 1664 analog radiographic cases of bone tumors and selected 811 cases (66 diagnoses) for annotation using a quantitative imaging platform. Leave-one-out cross validation was performed. Primary accuracy was defined as the correct pathological diagnosis as the top machine prediction. Differential accuracy was defined as whether the correct pathological diagnosis was within the top three predictions. For the 29 most common diagnoses (710 cases), primary accuracy was 44%, and differential accuracy was 60%. For the top 10 most common diagnoses (478 cases), primary accuracy was 62%, and differential accuracy was 80%. The machine returned relevant diagnoses for the majority of unknown test cases and may be a feasible alternative to machine learning approaches such as deep neural networks or support vector machines that typically require larger training data (our model required a minimum of five samples per diagnosis) and are “black boxes” (our model can provide details of probability calculations to identify features that most significantly contribute to truth diagnoses). Finally, our Bayes model was designed to scale and “learn” from external data, enabling incorporation of outside knowledge such as Dahlin’s Bone Tumors, a reference of anatomic and demographic statistics of more than 10,000 tumors.",

This article provides an overview of the underlying design and functionality of radiological decision support systems with examples tracing the development and evolution of such systems over the past 40 years. More importantly, we discuss the specific design, performance and usage characteristics that previous systems have highlighted as being necessary for clinical uptake and routine use.

The system offers case specific advice from an expert system (ES), general information on the lesion area and allows for recording and retrieving cases. The ES utilizes both rule-based and probabilistic inferencing methodologies to arrive at a differential diagnosis (DD). The knowledge base was validated on 105 cases with known outcome. Clinical evaluation consisted of 59 new cases whose final diagnosis was not known to the evaluators. The correct diagnosis was included in the system's DD in 85% of the cases, which is comparable to the diagnostic accuracy of senior radiologists (88%). The system proved to be helpful to the expert, diagnosing cases missed by the radiologists and suggesting additional diagnoses not listed by the radiologists, raising their diagnostic capability to 91%.",

Overall, the network was 85% accurate in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. With a differential list of five diagnoses, the list was internally consistent regarding benign and malignant lesions 81.9% of the time. The network correctly diagnosed 56% of the lesions by pathologic diagnosis as its first choice. It included the correct diagnosis 71.8% of the time in a differential list of three diagnoses and 87.3% of the time in a differential list of nine diagnoses.\nCONCLUSION: Although not yet adequate for clinical use, neural network diagnosis of bone lesions is in its infancy and has important implications for the future analysis of focal bone lesions.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: The interobserver-variability of radiological diagnosis of benign bone tumors (BBT) and tumor-like lesions (TLL) was examined in order to identify difficult-to-diagnose entities, to examine the frequency of advanced diagnostics and to describe the number of interdisciplinary tumor center diagnoses (IDT) in comparison with diagnoses upon referral (ED) and radiologists´ diagnoses (RD).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 413 patients with 272 BBT and 141 TLL, classified either histologically or through interdisciplinary consultation. Discrepancies between groups were analyzed and rates of additional imaging and biopsy to establish diagnosis were assessed.\nRESULTS: In BBT the number of identical radiological diagnoses was 56 (ED) and 81 % (RD) compared to the IDT, while in the latter additional imaging were obtained in 30 % cases. In 21 % (12 % to establish diagnosis) BBT were biopsied, the ED matching the histology 40 %, the RD 60 % and the IDT 76 % of the time. For TLL diagnosed through radiology, ED and RD matched IDT 31 % and 61 % of the time, with additional imaging being obtained in 21 % of cases (IDT). In 36 % (27 % to establish diagnosis) biopsy was performed, with histological diagnosis matching the IDT, RD and ED in 51, 27 and 20 %. Diagnostic challenges were apparent in enchondromas, non-ossifying fibromas (NOF), solitary (SBC) and aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC). Ganglia can be misinterpreted as a tumor.\nCONCLUSIONS: Establishing a definitive diagnosis for BBT and TLL can be challenging with the latter posing greater difficulties. An interdisciplinary approach involving radiologists, orthopedics and pathologists was found to improve diagnostic accuracy.\nKEY POINTS: • Benign bone tumors (BBT) and tumor-like lesions (TLL) present a diagnostic challenge, while enchondroma, NOF, SBC and ABC were difficult to diagnose, and ganglia can be misinterpreted as a tumor• Additional imaging studies were required for diagnosis in 29 % and 21 % of cases for BBT and TLL, respectively, biopsies in 12 % of cases for BBT and 27 % for TLL• Sound diagnoses can be made through interdisciplinary case discussion, while reducing the risk of overtreatment Citation Format: • Scheitza P, Uhl M, Hauschild O et al.

		"abstract": "Incidental bone lesions are commonly seen on abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) examinations. These incidental bone lesions can be diagnostically challenging to the abdominal radiologist who may not be familiar with their appearance or their appropriate management. The characterization of such bone lesions as non-aggressive or aggressive based on their CT appearance involves similar principles to their morphologic evaluation on radiographs. Knowledge of the age of the patient and the presence of symptoms, mainly bone pain, can improve analysis. Examples of bone lesions that may be encountered include solitary or multifocal bone lesions, osteochondromatous and chondroid tumors, Paget’s disease, avascular necrosis/bone infarctions, iatrogenic lesions, and periarticular lesions. This pictorial essay aims to provide a framework for the analysis of incidental bone lesions on CT and when further imaging and clinical work-up should be recommended.",

		"abstract": "Osteoporotic vertebral fractures constitute at least 50% of the osteoporotic fractures that happen worldwide. Occurrence of osteoporotic fractures make the elderly patient susceptible for further fractures and increases the morbidity due to kyphosis and pain; the mortality risk is also increased in these patients. Most fractures occur in the thoracic and thoracolumbar region and are often stable. Different descriptive and prognostic classification systems have been described, but none are universally accepted. Radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are useful in imaging the fracture and evaluating the bone density. In acute stages, the fractures are well treated with conservative measures including short bed rest, analgesics, bracing, and exercises. Although most fractures heal well, up to 30% of fractures can develop painful nonunion, progressive kyphosis, and neurological deficit. For patients who develop severe pain not responding to nonoperative measures and painful nonunion, percutaneous cement augmentation procedures including vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty have been suggested. For fractures with severe collapse and that lead to neurological deficit and increasing kyphosis, instrumented stabilization is advised. Prevention and management of osteoporosis is the key element in the management of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly. Guidelines for essential adequate dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D, and antiosteoporotic medications have been described.",

		"abstract": "Hip resurfacing is a common method for therapy of coxarthritis and is currently under discussion. The aim of this study was to analyze hip resurfacing follow-up studies with more than 5 years follow-up time. A total of 17 studies which matched the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The survival rate after 5-6 years was 96.3%, after 7-8 years 93.8% and after 9-10 years 90%. Young men with primary coxarthritis and surgery by an experienced surgeon showed the best results. The main causes for revision were aseptic loosening with 34.4% and fracture of the proximal femur with 31.9%. Dislocation as a cause for revision was rare and occurred in 2.8% of all cases. Hip resurfacing showed worse results than conventional hip arthroplasty. The risk for complications was high especially for women, with small prostheses and in patients with suboptimal positioning of the prosthesis.",

		"abstract": "Background:\nIntraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) is a technique that is helpful for assessing the nervous system during spine surgery.\n\nMethods:\nThis is a review of the field describing the basic mechanisms behind the techniques of IONM. These include the most often utilized trancranial motor evoked potentials (Tc-MEPs), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and stimulated and spontaneous EMG activity. It also describes some of the issues regarding practices and qualifications of practitioners.\n\nResults:\nAlthough the anatomic pathways responsible for the Tc-MEP and SSEP are well known and these clinical techniques have a high sensitivity and specificity, there is little published data showing that monitoring actually leads to improved patient outcomes. It is evident that IONM has high utility when the risk of injury is high, but may be only marginally helpful when the risk of injury is very low. The monitoring team must be well trained, be able to provide the surgeon feedback in real time, and coordinate activities with those of the surgical and anesthesia teams.\n\nConclusions:\nAlthough IONM is a valuable technique that provides sensitive and specific indications of neurologic injury, it does have limitations that must be understood. Maintaining a high quality of practice with appropriately trained personnel is critical.",

Forty-five patients waiting for an uncemented THA had templating performed of their digital picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) pelvic images with the TraumaCad software program (Orthocrat Ltd, Petach-Tikva, Israel). Acetabular cup size, femoral stem size, and femoral offset were noted by 2 observers, and again by 1 of the observers a week later. Through correlation coefficients and significance testing, the degree of intraobserver and interobserver variability was evaluated, as well as the level of accuracy for digital templating. Excellent correlation was found for all data sets, with no significant difference between them in intraobserver reproducibility. Also in terms of interobserver reproducibility, we found good levels of correlation, with no significant difference between the data sets. In terms of accuracy, the correlation was at least acceptable with no significant difference between any of the data sets. The use of the TraumaCad digital software program provides a reliable method of templating digital images for uncemented THAs. There is little intraobserver and interobserver variability, and the method produces an acceptable level of accuracy.",

		"abstract": "Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) are benign osteolytic vascular lesions that are capable of aggressive local expansion and bone destruction. These tumors are most common in adolescent patients and constitute approximately 9% of benign tumors. ABCs can present a diagnostic challenge, as they share several histological and radiographic characteristics with more aggressive lesions, including giant cell tumors and malignant telangiectatic osteosarcomas. The management of ABCs is diverse, but the most common approach includes lesion curettage with bone grafting. Here, we present the case of a large, central ABC of the distal femur in a young, previously healthy female who presented to the emergency room with a pathologic fracture.",

		"abstract": "The indications for surgical treatment of benign bone tumors and tumor-like lesions depend on the biological activity, clinical symptoms and anatomic location of the the lesion. Clinically silent lesions (\"leave me alone Lesions\") lacking any scintigraphic enhancement and without danger of pathologic fracture or malign transformation only need surveillance and do not require surgery.However, tumors becoming symptomatic, displaying progression after termination of skeletal growth or radiographic signs of malignancy should be scheduled for surgical intervention. For most benign tumors intralesional curettage and subsequent bone grafting is the treatment of choice, maintaining structural integrity and functional stability of the bone and adjacent joint. In case of uncertain histopathological diagnosis an open biopsy should be performed followed by definitive either marginal or en-bloc resection, preferably at a single procedure. Depending on the tumor-specific risk of recurrence, adjuvant measures as phenol instillation or cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen may additionally be applied. As for the unicameral juvenile bone cyst or osteoid osteoma alternative minimal invasive techniques like corticoid injection and CT-guided percutaneous eradication of the nidus have been successfully introduced into clinical practice. Depending on the activity of the tumor recurrent lesions are recommended to be treated by marginal or enbloc resection. The radical and aggressive mode of surgical therapy has to be balanced with the treatment-related morbidity, i.e. complication rate, possibilities for reconstructive stabilizations and resultant functional deficits,making the decision a responsible challenge to the orthopedic surgeon.",

Malignant tumors are characterized by a local aggressive and destructive behavior. The behavior of a tumor is dependent on its entity, the differentiation grade and localization and these factors are of decisive importance for the correct therapy. Even benign tumors can behave very aggressively. Different stages are defined. Patient history and conventional radiographs are the most powerful primary diagnostic tools. Many tumors show typical characteristics and if a malignant lesion is suspected a biopsy should be carried out. Several quality standards have to be respected when making the biopsy. The approach to malignant tumors is always interdisciplinary. Several biological as well as alloplastic reconstruction techniques exist.

		"abstract": "Objective is to identify epidemiologic and radiologic criteria allowing specific diagnoses of tumors and tumor-like lesions in the hip region and pelvis, and to optimize pre-operative staging. Patients with pelvic tumors are usually older, and their tumors are larger relative to patients with tumors in extremities. The majority of tumors in the pelvis are malignant (metastases, myeloma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing-, osteo-, and MFH/fibrosarcoma), while those in the proximal femur are in majority benign (fibrous dysplasia, solitary bone cyst, and osteoid osteoma). Soft tissue masses in the thigh in the elderly are typically sarcomas without tumor specific signs. Common tumor-like lesions occurring in the hip and pelvis that can mimic neoplasm are: infections (including tuberculosis), insufficiency/avulsion fractures, cysts, fibrous dysplasia, aneurysmal bone cyst, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and Paget's disease. Local MR staging is based on the compartmental anatomy. The psoas and gluteal muscles are easily invaded by sarcoma originating in the ileum. The pectineus muscle protects the neurovascular bundle at the level of the hip. The thigh is separated into three compartments, some structures (Sartorius muscle) cross borders between compartments. Immobile joints (SI-joints, osteoarthritic hip) are relatively easily crossed by sarcoma and giant cell tumor.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The combination of osteoblastoma and aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) in the cervical spine is a relatively rare occurrence in the general population. The diagnosis and surgical management of osteoblastoma and ABCs have been previously described in a small number of case reports/series and orthopedic texts. Lesions of the cervical spine pose challenges to surgeons that require preoperative planning and intraoperative decisions to ensure an appropriate patient outcome. Complete resection has been shown to be the most effective method for preventing recurrence; however, balancing spinal stability, future mobility, and complete resection is especially important in active young patients.\nPURPOSE: We describe a modern approach to the surgical management of osteoblastoma with secondary ABC of the cervical spine with 4-year clinical and radiographic follow-up. Included in this report is a comprehensive review of the literature related to osteoblastoma, ABCs, and surgical issues pertinent to them.\nSTUDY DESIGN: An independent retrospective case review combined with a review of current literature was performed.\nPATIENT SAMPLE: A single patient with a combination of osteoblastoma and secondary ABC is presented.\nOUTCOME MEASURES: During 4 years of follow-up, the patient has been evaluated with plain radiographs for subluxation or rotation of the cervical spine. Postoperative assessments for pain and range of motion were also collected.\nMETHODS: The medical, pathologic, and radiographic records of a case of osteoblastoma with secondary aneursymal bone cyst of the cervical spine were reviewed. A computer-based literature search of the PubMed database was used to compile a comprehensive review of the topic.\nRESULTS: The diagnosis and surgical treatment of osteoblastoma with secondary ABC in the cervical spine are discussed in the context of a literature review. The surgical management of this lesion was dictated by the size and location of the mass as well as the impact of the surgical resection on surrounding structures in terms of spinal stability and future mobility.\nCONCLUSIONS: The combination of osteoblastoma and ABC in the cervical spine is an uncommon occurrence in the general population. In the cervical spine, careful surgical planning and a case-by-case evaluation must be implemented to minimize morbidity and recurrence for every patient.",

		"abstract": "Aneurysmal bone cysts are rare skeletal tumors that most commonly occur in the first two decades of life. They primarily develop about the knee but may arise in any portion of the axial or appendicular skeleton. Pathogenesis of these tumors remains controversial and may be vascular, traumatic, or genetic. Radiographic features include a dilated, radiolucent lesion typically located within the metaphyseal portion of the bone, with fluid-fluid levels visible on MRI. Histologic features include blood-filled lakes interposed between fibrous stromata. Differential diagnosis includes conditions such as telangiectatic osteosarcoma and giant cell tumor. The mainstay of treatment is curettage and bone graft, with or without adjuvant treatment. Other management options include cryotherapy, sclerotherapy, radionuclide ablation, and en bloc resection. The recurrence rate is low after appropriate treatment; however, more than one procedure may be required to completely eradicate the lesion.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patellar tumors are rare; only a few series have been described in the literature and radiographic diagnosis can be challenging. We reviewed all patellar tumors at one institution and reviewed the literature.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In an evaluation of the database at one institution from 1916 to 2009, 23,000 bone tumors were found. Of these, 41 involved the patella. All had imaging studies and microscopic diagnostic confirmation. All medical records, imaging studies, and pathology were reviewed.\nRESULTS: There were 15 females and 26 males, ranging from 8 to 68 years old (average 30). There were 30 benign tumors; eight giant cell tumors, eight chondroblastomas, seven osteoid osteomas, two aneurysmal bone cysts, two ganglions, one each of chondroma, exostosis, and hemangioma. There were 11 malignant tumors: five hemangioendotheliomas, three metastases, one lymphoma, one plasmacytoma, and one angiosarcoma.\nCONCLUSION: Patellar tumors are rare and usually benign. As the patella is an apophysis, the most frequent lesions are giant cell tumor in the adult and chondroblastoma in children. Osteoid osteomas were frequent in our series and easily diagnosed. Metastases are the most frequent malignant diagnoses in the literature; in our series malignant vascular tumors were more common. These lesions are often easily analyzed on radiographs. CT and MR define better the cortex, soft tissue extension, and fluid levels. This study presents the imaging patterns of the more common patellar tumors in order to help the radiologist when confronted with a lesion in this location.",

A wide variety of benign neoplasms can involve the spine including enostosis, osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, giant cell tumor, and osteochondroma. Common malignant primary neoplasms are chordoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and osteosarcoma.

		"abstract": "Background\nFibrous dysplasia is a benign fibroosseous bone tumor that accounts for 5% to 10% of benign bone tumors. It can present as monostotic fibrous dysplasia (70% to 80%), polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (20% to 30%), McCune-Albright syndrome (2% to 3%), or Mazabraud’s syndrome in rare cases. Bone lesions in fibrous dysplasia arise in the medullary canal and usually are confined to the bone. Cortical destruction and extension into soft tissue usually indicates malignant transformation or secondary aneurysmal bone cyst formation. Locally aggressive fibrous dysplasia with cortical destruction and extension into soft tissue in the absence of these two possibilities is extremely rare. It is important for the treating physician to distinguish this entity from more aggressive or malignant tumors to avoid overtreating the patient for a benign condition or inattention to a malignant tumor.\n\nCase Descriptions\nWe report four unusual cases of fibrous dysplasia with an aggressive radiographic appearance. They occurred in the rib (1), ilium (2), and distal femur (1). Two patients had pain and two had swelling. Radiologically, all were associated with cortical destruction and an associated soft tissue mass, and initially they were interpreted as potentially malignant. Three patients underwent biopsy and one patient did not have a biopsy. Histopathologic analysis by an experienced bone pathologist confirmed fibrous dysplasia in all patients. Two patients were treated surgically; one patient with zoledronic acid and one patient currently is being followed by observation alone.\n\nLiterature Review\nThere are only a few reports in the literature that describe the locally aggressive variant of fibrous dysplasia that presents with pain and progressive swelling clinically and with cortical destruction and soft tissue extension on imaging which suggest malignancy. We could not find any article that describes the use of bisphosphonates in such lesions or the response to bisphosphonates clinically, on laboratory parameters or imaging. To our knowledge, this is the largest case report published regarding locally aggressive fibrous dysplasia arising outside the craniofacial skeleton.\n\nClinical Relevance\nThe locally aggressive variant of fibrous dysplasia may be confused with a malignant tumor or malignant degeneration of fibrous dysplasia. It is important to properly evaluate these lesions to ensure that a proper diagnosis is made, especially with respect to a malignant versus benign mass.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone cysts are benign tumor-like lesions which often present as a fluid-containing cavity in the bone. They can occur in the skeletal bone as solitary or sometimes multiple bone lesions.\nOBJECTIVES: This review discusses the diagnostics, radiological appearance and therapeutic strategies of the most important benign cystic bone lesions, such as simple bone cysts, aneurysmal bone cysts, intraosseous ganglia, epidermoid cysts and subchondral cysts. The differential diagnoses with respect to cystoid formations and tumors with cystic components are discussed.\nMETHOD: A selective literature search was performed taking own experiences into consideration.\nRESULTS: These tumor-like lesions can have the radiological appearance of bone tumors but show no autonomic, stimulus-independent growth and can resolve spontaneously. In the majority of cases open biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. In some cases no surgical intervention is necessary (e.g. do not touch and leave me alone lesions), whereas in other cases the focus of treatment is on the prevention and therapy of pathological fractures as well as prevention of recurrence.\nCONCLUSION: Cystic bone formations are among the most commonly occurring non-traumatic bone lesions. To eliminate differential diagnostic unclarity, histological investigation of biopsy material is essential. In terms of surgical intervention there exists a trend towards multimodal therapy mostly based on a meticulous curretage.",

		"abstract": "Interventional radiology technique is now well established and widely used in the adult population. Through minimally invasive procedures, it increasingly replaces surgical interventions that involve higher percentages of invasiveness and, consequently, of morbidity and mortality. For these advantageous reasons, interventional radiology in recent years has spread to the paediatric age as well. The aim of this study was to review the literature on the development, use and perspectives of these procedures in the paediatric musculoskeletal field. Several topics are covered: osteomuscle neoplastic malignant and benign pathologies treated with invasive diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures such as radiofrequency ablation in the osteoid osteoma; invasive and non-invasive procedures in vascular malformations; treatment of aneurysmal bone cysts; and role of interventional radiology in paediatric inflammatory and rheumatic inflammations. The positive results that have been generated with interventional radiology procedures in the paediatric field highly encourage both the development of new ad hoc materials, obviously adapted to young patients, as well as the improvement of such techniques, in consideration of the fact that childrens' pathologies do not always correspond to those of adults. In conclusion, as these interventional procedures have proven to be less invasive, with lower morbidity and mortality rates as well, they are becoming a viable and valid alternative to surgery in the paediatric population.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although curettage of an aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) of the clavicle has a high rate of local recurrence, segmental resection is often avoided for treatment as it causes functional impairment and shoulder deformity. We evaluated the rate of local recurrence and functional outcomes of extended curettage vs. segmental resection with bone reconstruction for the treatment of clavicular ABC.\nMETHODS: A total of 14 patients with clavicular ABC were studied. Extended curettage and segmental resection with bone reconstruction were done for 6 and 8 patients, respectively. The number of local recurrences and postoperative complications was recorded for each group. The function of the shoulder was assessed using the Constant-Murley score.\nRESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 26.2 ± 14.7 years (range, 4-56 years). At a mean follow-up of 60 ± 37.6 months, 2 recurrences developed, both in the curettage group. Two postoperative complications (1 infection and 1 nonunion) were also recorded, both in the segmental resection group. The mean Constant-Murley score was 88.2 ± 3.4 in the extended curettage group and 87.3 ± 2.4 in the segmental resection group (P = .85).\nCONCLUSIONS: Considering the comparable function of the shoulder in curettage and segmental resection with bone reconstruction in clavicular ABC, we recommend the latter approach because of the lower recurrence rate, albeit with a higher rate of potential complications.",

In the image studies with CT and MRI a lytic and expansive lession was found in the upper part of the right acetabulum and right iliac wing, all of which suggested an aneurysmal bone cyst with an associated acetabular fracture. A biopsy was performed which confirmed the diagnosis. He was treated with a CT-guided embolization and, due to its size, curetagge and allograft filling afterwards.

		"abstract": "Unicameral bone cysts (UBC) or simple/solitary bone cysts are benign fluid filled cavities that enlarge over time, resulting in thinning of the bone. Usually these cysts are reported in the metaphyseal areas of long bones with open physes. 85% of UBCs occur almost exclusively in children and adolescents. UBCs are more aggressive in the first decade of life and correspondingly the recurrence rate for these patients is four times that for adolescents. The proximal humerus and femur account for almost 90% of these cases. UBCs are classified as active when they are within 1 cm of the physis and latent as they progress to a diaphyseal location. Differential diagnoses for UBC include aneurysmal bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, enchondroma, and intraosseous ganglia. By the time of skeletal maturity most UBCs tend to resolve. Nonoperative treatment may be a viable option for many patients with small or symptomatic lesions. Interventions include steroid injection, open curettage and bone grafting, decompression and percutaneous injection of marrow or graft substitutes.",

		"abstract": "Simple and aneurysmal bone cysts are benign lytic bone lesions, usually encountered in children and adolescents. Simple bone cyst is a cystic, fluid-filled lesion, which may be unicameral (UBC) or partially separated. UBC can involve all bones, but usually the long bone metaphysis and otherwise primarily the proximal humerus and proximal femur. The classic aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is an expansive and hemorrhagic tumor, usually showing characteristic translocation. About 30% of ABCs are secondary, without translocation; they occur in reaction to another, usually benign, bone lesion. ABCs are metaphyseal, excentric, bulging, fluid-filled and multicameral, and may develop in all bones of the skeleton. On MRI, the fluid level is evocative. It is mandatory to distinguish ABC from UBC, as prognosis and treatment are different. UBCs resolve spontaneously between adolescence and adulthood; the main concern is the risk of pathologic fracture. Treatment in non-threatening forms consists in intracystic injection of methylprednisolone. When there is a risk of fracture, especially of the femoral neck, surgery with curettage, filling with bone substitute or graft and osteosynthesis may be required. ABCs are potentially more aggressive, with a risk of bone destruction. Diagnosis must systematically be confirmed by biopsy, identifying soft-tissue parts, as telangiectatic sarcoma can mimic ABC. Intra-lesional sclerotherapy with alcohol is an effective treatment. In spinal ABC and in aggressive lesions with a risk of fracture, surgical treatment should be preferred, possibly after preoperative embolization. The risk of malignant transformation is very low, except in case of radiation therapy.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of projectional radiography in the detection of primary and potentially malignant bone neoplasms.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the images and medical records of 80 patients (42 male, 38 female; range: 6 to 73 years; mean: 33 years) with pathologically proven primary or indeterminate bone tumors.\nRESULTS: The most common symptom was local pain (84 %). In 69 of 80 patients (86 %), projectional radiography was the first imaging modality, which correctly identified the malignant character of the bone lesion in 60 of these 69 patients (87 %). In 2 patients, bone neoplasms were overlooked due to diagnostically inadequte image quality. The false-diagnosis rate was not significantly different between board-certified radiologists working in hospitals and radiologists in outpatient facilities (p > 0.05). Bone tumors predominantly affecting adults, such as chondrosarcomas, needed a longer time for the diagnosis than bone tumors mainly found in childhood, such as osteosarcomas. The median age of patients with delayed imaging work-up because of attempted conservative therapy (45 years +/- 20 years) was significant higher than the median age of patients with immediate radiographic work-up (27 years +/- 16 years).\nCONCLUSION: Projectional radiography is the most common initial imaging method for bone pain and continues to play an important role to reduce the time gap between first onset of symptoms and definitive treatment. In unremitting focal bone pain, bone neoplasms should be taken into consideration not only in children but also in patients beyond adolescence.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE. Lodwick’s well-established grading system of lytic bone lesions has been widely used in predicting growth rate for lytic bone lesions. We applied a Modified LodwickMadewell Grading System as an alternative means to categorize lytic bone tumors into those with low, moderate, and high risks of malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review of the radiographs of 183 bone lesions was performed. Cases were selected to include a broad range of benign and malignant tumors. Readers applied our Modified Lodwick-Madewell Grading System, and consensus was reached in all cases. This modified system consists of grade I, which is composed of grades IA and IB as listed in the Lodwick system; grade II, which is grade IC in the Lodwick system; and grade III, which is composed of IIIA (changing margination), IIB (moth-eaten and permeative patterns), and IIIC (radiographically occult). Grading was correlated with the final diagnosis.\nRESULTS. Of the 183 tumors, 81 were classified as grade I, 54 as grade II, and 48 as grade III. When correlating grade with pathology, we found that 76 of 81 (94%) grade I lesions were benign and 39 of 48 grade III lesions (81%) were malignant. A nearly equal number of grade II lesions proved to be benign (29/54; 54%) and malignant (28/54; 53%).\nCONCLUSION. By expanding Lodwick’s grading system to include two additional patterns of disease described by Madewell and colleagues (changing margination and radiographically occult) and by reclassifying them into three distinct grades, we propose a modified system—the Modified Lodwick-Madewell Grading System. Application of this system shows correlation of tumor grade with tumor biologic activity and with risk of malignancy: Grade I lesions are usually benign, grade II lesions carry moderate risk of malignancy, and grade III lesions possess a high likelihood of malignancy.",

		"abstract": "Acquiring laparoscopic surgical skills involves initial learning of cognitive and motor skills followed by refinement of those skills. The successful use of a virtual reality simulator depends on the quality of the interface for the human-computer interaction and this can be determined by the initial learning rate. MIST VR, a part-task virtual reality laparoscopic simulator, provides objective assessment of psychomotor skills and can generate an overall score for performance, based upon errors made and time taken for six different tasks. This study analysed the rate of early task/instrument/computer familiarization on consecutive scores achieved by surgically experienced and naive individuals. Eleven surgeons, 18 medical students and seven non-medical personnel were tested on the simulator up to ten consecutive times, within a 2-week period. Performance data from every task and repetition were analysed to obtain individual scores of task performance. The calculation of overall score penalized errors far more heavily than total time taken, with high scores indicating poor performance. The surgeon-computer interface generated a rapid and significant early familiarization curve up to the third session on the simulator, with significant reductions in both time taken and total contact errors made. These results suggest that MIST VR represents a high quality interface. Surgeons scored consistently and significantly better than other subjects on all tasks. For surgically naive individuals, it was possible to predict the level of laparoscopic skills performance that would be attained after overcoming initial simulator learning curve, by studying their initial score. Overall scores reflected surgical experience and suggest that the simulator is measuring surgically relevant parameters. MIST VR provides a validated and much needed method for objective assessment of laparoscopic skills, for a variety of surgical disciplines.",

It provides an easy-tounderstand score from 0 (negative) to 100 (positive). While a 100-point scale is intuitive in many respects and allows for relative judgments, information describing how the numeric score translates into an absolute judgment of usability is not known. To help answer that question, a seven-point adjective-anchored Likert scale was added as an eleventh question to nearly 1,000 SUS surveys. Results show that the Likert scale scores correlate extremely well with the SUS scores (r=0.822). The addition of the adjective rating scale to the SUS may help practitioners interpret individual SUS scores and aid in explaining the results to non-human factors professionals.",

Sterility provides an implied theme and motivation for the field as a whole, but other advantages, such as hands-busy settings, are also proposed. Overcoming hardware restrictions has been a major theme, but in recent research, technical difficulties have receded. Image navigation is the most frequently considered task and the operating room the most frequently considered environment. Gestures have been implemented for input, system and content control. Most of the studies found have small sample sizes and focus on feasibility, acceptability or gesture-recognition accuracy. We conclude this article with an agenda for future work.",

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.",

		"abstract": "Confronted with worldwide evidence of substantial public health harm due to inadequate patient safety, the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2002 adopted a resolution (WHA55.18) urging countries to strengthen the safety of health care and monitoring systems. The resolution also requested that WHO take a lead in setting global norms and standards and supporting country efforts in preparing patient safety policies and practices. In May 2004, the WHA approved the creation of an international alliance to improve patient safety globally; WHO Patient Safety was launched the following October. For the first time, heads of agencies, policy-makers and patient groups from around the world came together to advance attainment of the goal of “First, do no harm” and to reduce the adverse consequences of unsafe health care. The purpose of WHO Patient Safety is to facilitate patient safety policy and practice. It is concentrating its actions on focused safety campaigns called Global Patient Safety Challenges, coordinating Patients for Patient Safety, developing a standard taxonomy, designing tools for research policy and assessment, identifying solutions for patient safety, and developing reporting and learning initiatives aimed at producing ‘best practice’ guidelines. Together these efforts could save millions of lives by improving basic health care and halting the diversion of resources from other productive uses. The Global Patient Safety Challenge, brings together the expertise of specialists to improve the safety of care. The area chosen for the first Challenge in 2005–2006, was infection associated with health care. This campaign established simple, clear standards for hand hygiene, an educational campaign and WHO's first Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care. The problem area selected for the second Global Patient Safety Challenge, in 2007–2008, was the safety of surgical care. Preparation of these Guidelines for Safe Surgery followed the steps recommended by WHO. The groundwork for the project began in autumn 2006 and included an international consultation meeting held in January 2007 attended by experts from around the world. Following this meeting, expert working groups were created to systematically review the available scientific evidence, to write the guidelines document and to facilitate discussion among the working group members in order to formulate the recommendations. A steering group consisting of the Programme Lead, project team members and the chairs of the four working groups, signed off on the content and recommendations in the guidelines document. Nearly 100 international experts contributed to the document (see end). The guidelines were pilot tested in each of the six WHO regions—an essential part of the Challenge—to obtain local information on the resources required to comply with the recommendations and information on the feasibility, validity, reliability and cost–effectiveness of the interventions.",

		"abstract": "Background\nThe increasingly pervasive presence of technology in the operating room raises the need to study the interaction between the surgeon and computer system. A new generation of tools known as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices enabling touchless gesture–based human-computer interaction is currently being explored as a solution in surgical environments.\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this systematic literature review was to provide an account of the state of the art of COTS devices in the detection of manual gestures in surgery and to identify their use as a simulation tool for motor skills teaching in minimally invasive surgery (MIS).\n\nMethods\nFor this systematic literature review, a search was conducted in PubMed, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, ScienceDirect, Espacenet, OpenGrey, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers databases. Articles published between January 2000 and December 2017 on the use of COTS devices for gesture detection in surgical environments and in simulation for surgical skills learning in MIS were evaluated and selected.\n\nResults\nA total of 3180 studies were identified, 86 of which met the search selection criteria. Microsoft Kinect (Microsoft Corp) and the Leap Motion Controller (Leap Motion Inc) were the most widely used COTS devices. The most common intervention was image manipulation in surgical and interventional radiology environments, followed by interaction with virtual reality environments for educational or interventional purposes. The possibility of using this technology to develop portable low-cost simulators for skills learning in MIS was also examined. As most of the articles identified in this systematic review were proof-of-concept or prototype user testing and feasibility testing studies, we concluded that the field was still in the exploratory phase in areas requiring touchless manipulation within environments and settings that must adhere to asepsis and antisepsis protocols, such as angiography suites and operating rooms.\n\nConclusions\nCOTS devices applied to hand and instrument gesture–based interfaces in the field of simulation for skills learning and training in MIS could open up a promising field to achieve ubiquitous training and presurgical warm up.",

		"abstract": "A recent article by Jamieson in Medical Education outlined some of the (alleged) abuses of “Likert scales” with suggestions about how researchers can overcome some of the (alleged) methodological pitfalls and limitations[1]. However, many of the ideas advanced in the Jamison article, as well as a great many of articles it cited, and similar recent articles in medical, health, psychology, and educational journals and books, are themselves common misunderstandings, misconceptions, conceptual errors, persistent myths and “urban legends” about “Likert scales” and their characteristics and qualities that have been propagated and perpetuated across six decades, for a variety of different reasons. This article identifies, analyses and traces many of these aforementioned problems and presents the arguments, counter arguments and empirical evidence that show these many persistent claims and myths about “Likert scales” to be factually incorrect and untrue. Many studies have shown that Likert Scales (as opposed to single Likert response format items) produce interval data and that the F-test is very robust to violations of the interval data assumption and moderate skewing and may be used to analyze “Likert data” (even if it is ordinal), but not on an item-by-item “shotgun” basis, which is simply a current research and analysis practice that must stop. After sixty years, it is more than time to dispel these particular research myths and urban legends as well as the various damage and problems they cause, and put them to bed and out of their misery once and for all.",

We further discuss the drawbacks of current solutions and underline promising technologies for future development.\nMethods A systematic literature search of scientiﬁc papers that deal with touchless control of medical software in the immediate environment of the operation room and interventional radiology suite was performed. This includes methods for touchless gesture interaction, voice control and eye tracking.\nResults Fifty-ﬁve research papers were identiﬁed and analyzed in detail including 33 journal publications. Most of the identiﬁed literature (62 %) deals with the control of medical image viewers. The others present interaction techniques for laparoscopic assistance (13 %), telerobotic assistance and operating room control (9 % each) as well as for robotic operating room assistance and intraoperative registration (3.5 % each). Only 8 systems (14.5 %) were tested in a real clinical environment, and 7 (12.7 %) were not evaluated at all.\nConclusion In the last 10 years, many advancements have led to robust touchless interaction approaches. However, only a few have been systematically evaluated in real operating room settings. Further research is required to cope with current limitations of touchless software interfaces in clinical environments. The main challenges for future research are",

		"abstract": "Keyboards, mice, and touch screens are a potential source of infection or contamination in operating rooms, intensive care units, and autopsy suites. The authors present a low-cost prototype of a system, which allows for touch-free control of a medical image viewer. This touch-free navigation system consists of a computer system (IMac, OS X 10.6 Apple, USA) with a medical image viewer (OsiriX, OsiriX foundation, Switzerland) and a depth camera (Kinect, Microsoft, USA). They implemented software that translates the data delivered by the camera and a voice recognition software into keyboard and mouse commands, which are then passed to OsiriX. In this feasibility study, the authors introduced 10 medical professionals to the system and asked them to re-create 12 images from a CT data set. They evaluated response times and usability of the system compared with standard mouse/keyboard control. Users felt comfortable with the system after approximately 10 minutes. Response time was 120 ms. Users required 1.4 times more time to re-create an image with gesture control. Users with OsiriX experience were significantly faster using the mouse/keyboard and faster than users without prior experience. They rated the system 3.4 out of 5 for ease of use in comparison to the mouse/keyboard. The touch-free, gesture-controlled system performs favorably and removes a potential vector for infection, protecting both patients and staff. Because the camera can be quickly and easily integrated into existing systems, requires no calibration, and is low cost, the barriers to using this technology are low.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: In the operating room (OR) a touchless interface is an ideal solution since it does not demand any physical contact and still can provide the necessary control features in a cleansed and sterilized environment.\nMETHODS: Using open-source software libraries and image processing techniques, we implemented a hand tracking and gesture recognition system based on the Kinect device that enables surgeon to successfully touchlessly navigate through the image in the intraoperative setting through a personal computer. We used the InVesalius software, which provides high-quality 3D reconstruction of medical images.\nRESULTS: Computed tomography data were intraoperatively fruitfully accessed through a simple and cheap solution in 4 tumor enucleations in 3 male patients in whom elective nephron-sparing surgeries were performed for small non-exophitic tumors. Mean tumor length was 2.7 cm (2.1, 2.7, 2.9 and 3.1 cm), and real-time ultrasound was not necessary for intraoperative identification in 3 of 4 endorenal tumors. All pathological reports revealed renal cell carcinoma, Fuhrman grade I, and negative inked surgical margins. No intra- or postoperative complication was reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: For the first time in the literature, a touchless user interface solution applying the Kinect device showed to be very efficient and enabled a low-cost and accurate control of the software InVesalius intraoperative, just using hand gestures. It can be used with any mouse-controlled software, opening an avenue for potential applications in many other areas, such as data visualization, augmented reality, accessibility, and robotics. The further validation and advancement of this technology are underway.",

		"abstract": "Objective\nGestural interfaces allow accessing and manipulating Electronic Medical Records (EMR) in hospitals while keeping a complete sterile environment. Particularly, in the Operating Room (OR), these interfaces enable surgeons to browse Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) without the need of delegating functions to the surgical staff. Existing gesture based medical interfaces rely on a suboptimal and an arbitrary small set of gestures that are mapped to a few commands available in PACS software. The objective of this work is to discuss a method to determine the most suitable set of gestures based on surgeon’s acceptability. To achieve this goal, the paper introduces two key innovations: (a) a novel methodology to incorporate gestures’ semantic properties into the agreement analysis, and (b) a new agreement metric to determine the most suitable gesture set for a PACS.\n\nMaterials and methods\nThree neurosurgical diagnostic tasks were conducted by nine neurosurgeons. The set of commands and gesture lexicons were determined using a Wizard of Oz paradigm. The gestures were decomposed into a set of 55 semantic properties based on the motion trajectory, orientation and pose of the surgeons’ hands and their ground truth values were manually annotated. Finally, a new agreement metric was developed, using the known Jaccard similarity to measure consensus between users over a gesture set.\n\nResults\nA set of 34 PACS commands were found to be a sufficient number of actions for PACS manipulation. In addition, it was found that there is a level of agreement of 0.29 among the surgeons over the gestures found. Two statistical tests including paired t-test and Mann Whitney Wilcoxon test were conducted between the proposed metric and the traditional agreement metric. It was found that the agreement values computed using the former metric are significantly higher (p < 0.001) for both tests.\n\nConclusions\nThis study reveals that the level of agreement among surgeons over the best gestures for PACS operation is higher than the previously reported metric (0.29 vs 0.13). This observation is based on the fact that the agreement focuses on main features of the gestures rather than the gestures themselves. The level of agreement is not very high, yet indicates a majority preference, and is better than using gestures based on authoritarian or arbitrary approaches. The methods described in this paper provide a guiding framework for the design of future gesture based PACS systems for the OR.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In this work, we aim at comparing formally three different interaction modes for image manipulation that are usable in a surgery setting: 1) A gesture-controlled approach using Kinect ®; 2) oral instructions to a third part dedicated to manipulate the images; and 3) direct manipulation using a mouse.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Each participant used the radiology image viewer Weasis with the three interaction modes. In a crossover randomized controlled trial participants were attributed block wise to six experimental groups. For each group, the order for testing the three modes was randomly assigned. Nine standardized scenarios were used.\nRESULTS: 30 physicians and senior medical students participated in the experiment. Efficiency, measured as time used to pass the scenario, was best when using the mouse (M = 109.10s, SD = 25.96), followed by gesture-controlled (M = 214.97s, SD = 46.29) and oral instructions (M = 246.33s, SD = 76.50). Satisfaction, measured by a questionnaire, was rated highest in the condition mouse (M = 6.63, SD = 0.56), followed by gesture-controlled (M = 5.77, SD = 0.93) and oral instructions (M = 4.40, SD = 1.71). Differences in efficiency and satisfaction rating were significant. No significant difference in effectiveness, measured with error rates, was found.\nDISCUSSION: The study shows with formal evaluation that the use of gestures is advantageous over instructions to a third person. In particular, the use of gestures is more efficient than verbalizing instructions. The given gestures could be learned easily and reliability of the tested gesture-control system is good.\nCONCLUSION: Under the premise that mouse cannot be used directly during surgery, gesture-controlled approaches demonstrate to be superior to oral instructions for image manipulation.",

		"abstract": "<h2>Abstract</h2><p>The 2016 RAD-AID Conference analyzed the accelerated global activity in the radiology community that is transforming medical imaging into an effective spearhead of health care capacity building in low- and middle-income countries. Global health efforts historically emphasized disaster response, crisis zones, and infectious disease outbreaks. However, the projected doubling of cancer and cardiovascular deaths in developing countries in the next 15 years and the need for higher technology screening and diagnostic technologies in low-resource regions, as articulated by the United Nations' new Sustainable Development Goals of 2016, is heightening the role of radiology in global health. Academic US-based radiology programs with RAD-AID chapters achieved a threefold increase in global health project offerings for trainees in the past 5 years. RAD-AID's nonprofit radiology volunteer corps continue to grow by more than 40% yearly, with a volunteer base of 5,750 radiology professionals, serving in 23 countries, donating close to 20,000 pro bono hours globally in 2016. As a high-technology specialty interfacing with nearly all medical and surgical disciplines, radiology underpins vital health technology infrastructure, such as digital imaging archives, electronic medical records, and advanced diagnosis and treatment, essential for long-term future health care capacity in underserved areas of the world.</p>",

		"abstract": "This article is concerned with the search for threshold values for bone quality beyond which the risk of fixation failure increased. For trochanteric fractures we recognized a BMD lower than 250mg/cm(3) as an additional risk for cut out. For medial femoral neck fractures since joint replacement surgery is available and produces excellent functional results, we see no indication for further differentiation or analysis of bone quality in relation to fracture fixation. In the area of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures, there are many experimental studies that try to identify BMD limits of screw fixation in the cancellous bone on the basis of QCT analysis. However, these values have not yet been introduced for application in clinical practice. In case of indication for surgical fixation, we favor minimally invasive, bisegmental, fourfold dorsal instrumentation with screw-augmentation for a T-value less than -2.0 SD (DXA analysis, total hip or total lumbar spine). For proximal humerus fractures, BMD value of 95mg/cm(3) could be seen as a threshold value below which the risk of failure rises markedly. In relation to osteoporotic distal radius fractures, based on our clinical experience and scientific analyses there are virtually no restrictions as far as bone quality is concerned on the application of palmar locking implants in the surgical management of distal radius fractures. Optimization of preoperative diagnostics might help to revise the treatment algorithm to take bone density into account, thus reducing the risk of failure and, at the same time, acquiring additional data for future reference.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: Chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF) is a benign tumour of the bone that typically occurs in long bone metaphysis. Spinal involvement is uncommon, but more frequent in the cervical and thoracic segments. Lumbar involvement is extremely rare. We report the ninth case of lumbar CMF and the first one involving the articular process of the vertebra. A review of the literature is also intended making special emphasis on the differential diagnosis with other benign spinal tumours of the bone.\nMETHODS: A 21-year-old Caucasian male suffering from low back pain that increased with sports and interrupted sleep was diagnosed with a tumoural lesion in the right inferior articular process of L5.\nRESULTS: Complete surgical excision of the tumour was accomplished. Histological diagnosis confirmed a CMF. The patient remains asymptomatic at 1-year follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the low incidence of CMF in the lumbar spine, differential diagnosis must include this subtype of lesion among other benign tumours of the bone and cartilage. Histological diagnosis is essential in order to provide the patient with an accurate management of the pathology. Recurrence rate is to be considered even in the case of complete surgical excision. Radiotherapy administration is controversial due to suspicion of malignant transformation of the tumour.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chondromyxoid fibroma is a rare benign primary bone tumor composed of immature myxoid mesenchymal and cartilaginous tissue. Its occurrence in calcaneus is very rare and few cases of calcaneal involvement have been reported in literature. We report five cases of CMF in calcaneus.\nMETHODS: Five cases, with the final diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma of the calcaneal bone are included in this report. Preoperative tumor workup was performed for our patients. We reviewed and recorded demographic data and the sign and symptoms of patients at presentation to our center. Mode of treatments, postoperative complications and recurrence were also studied. Curettage, high speed burring and bone grafting was performed in 4 of our patients and in the remaining case we only carried out curettage and burring.\nRESULTS: Of the five patients, 3 were male and 2 were female. The mean age at presentation was 21. Two of our cases had previous surgery in other centers and had been referred to our clinic because of recurrence. The chief complaint in all of our patients was heel pain. The mean follow up period was 25.2 months. All of our patients had a delay in the diagnosis of tumor. We did not have any recurrence in our patients during follow up period.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case series shows that chondromyxoid fibroma is not necessarily as exceedingly rare as generally reported in the current literature. This tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with ankle and heel pain.",

Although the age range is wide, it is most commonly seen in the second and third decades. The most frequent location of CMF is in the long tubular bones of the lower extremities, particularly the proximal tibia and distal femur. Although the majority of chondromyxoid fibromas present as intramedullary tumors, a subgroup of chondromyxoid fibromas arising as surface lesions of the bone has recently been described. These are associated with an older mean age and an increased incidence of matrix calcifications. Chondromyxoid fibromas are rare in the distal ulna. We report a CMF presenting as a surface lesion of the distal metaphysis of the left ulna in a 41-year-old woman. We reviewed the literature on chondromyxoid fibromas involving the ulna and found that out of 22 cases, 1 was in the distal ulna, 13 in the proximal ulna, and in the remaining 8 the ulnar sites were unspecified. No case of chondromyxoid fibroma in the published literature had been designated as a surface lesion. Our own unpublished data include 70 chondromyxoid fibromas, 4 of which are in the ulna. Two of these are in the distal portion.",

According to radiological examination, a malign chondroid bone tumor was excluded, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of CMF. The patient underwent aggressive curettage and bone grafting 6 years ago. Pelvic bones are encountered as rare localizations for CMFs. Pubic ramus is accepted as an exceptional site for this benign bone tumor of cartilaginous origin. To our knowledge, no any other CMF case in this localization has been reported in the literature. In atypical regions such as the pelvis and pubic ramus, CMF must be considered for differential diagnosis of malign tumors.",

The occurrence of intracortical CMFs is extremely rare. Very few cases of intracortical CMFs located in the long tubular bones have been reported to date. Moreover, even though the feet are the second most common site for CMF (after the knees), intracortical metatarsal CMF has not been reported previously, to our knowledge. We report an intracortical CMF occurring in the diaphysis of the metatarsal in a 17-year-old man. It showed the same imaging findings as usual intramedullary CMFs, except for its cortical location. The development and serial increase in this tumor over time are also demonstrated in this report. Additionally, we present a review of current literature on intracortical CMFs.",

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate radiological findings in patients with chondroblastoma (CB) in tubular and non-tubular bones (NTBs).\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with CB. Data collected included patients' gender and age, type, size and location of bone involved, and imaging findings regarding border, lobulation, calcification, trabeculation, cortical expansion and destruction, periosteal reaction, soft tissue component and fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging and/or multidetector computed tomography were used to determine the presence of any internal cystic space or secondary aneurysmal bone cyst that may have affected the radiological appearance of CB.\nRESULTS: All 31 lesions (18 tubular bones, 13 NTBs) exhibited geographic bone destruction and did not involve the adjacent joints. Univariate analysis showed that NTB lesions were found in older patients and were associated with thin trabeculation (p < 0.01) and well-defined margins (p < 0.05), whereas tubular bone lesions correlated with thick trabeculation and partially ill-defined margins. On multivariate analysis, age and type of bone involvement were significantly correlated. An increase in age by one year reduced the risk of having tubular bone involvement by about 27% when compared with NTBs (p = 0.011). Thin trabeculation was also significantly correlated with NTB lesions.\nCONCLUSION: Age was the most significant parameter, as increased age was found to reduce the risk of tubular bone involvement. Patients with NTB lesions were significantly older than those with tubular bone lesions. Based on imaging alone, thin trabeculation showed significant correlation with CB occurring in NTBs on both univariate and multivariate analyses.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The majority of benign bone tumors are cartilage tumors. Most common are enchondroma and osteochondroma. Often they represent incidental findings in radiological diagnostics. Thus, the incidence of cartilage tumors is unknown, as most of them are never diagnosed due to the absence of any symptoms.\nOBJECTIVES: This article describes the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of benign cartilage tumors, focusing on incidental findings.\nMETHODS: The current knowledge and our own experience in the diagnostics and treatment of benign condroid tumors are presented.\nRESULTS: As enchondroma represent most often the classic incidental finding without any symptoms or clinical findings, osteochondroma are often diagnosed in young patients by clinical examination showing a painless swelling that can increase in size according to skeletal growth. Most of these asymptomatic enchondroma and osteochondroma are so called \"leave me alone lesions\" and do not need any treatment, while other benign tumors (e.g., atypical cartilage tumors, chondroblastoma, chondromyxoidfibroma or osteochondroma with a cartilage cap of over 2 cm) need surgical treatment. These active or local aggressive tumors must be differentiated from the \"leave me alone lesions\". Additionally, patients with syndromes like Ollier disease (enchondromatosis), Maffucci syndrome or hereditary multiple exostosis must be examined and checked carefully as malignant degradation is possible.\nCONCLUSION: As most cartilage tumors are benign and remain benign, inappropriate diagnostics or operative treatment just to provide security is obsolete. Plain X-ray is often enough for follow-up and other modalities only become necessary when symptoms occur.",

Males in their second decade of life are most often affected, presenting with an insidious onset of localized pain, swelling, and tenderness. The finding of associated pathologic fracture has been rare. Imaging studies can aid in the formulation of the differential diagnosis and surgical plan. The definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination. Curettage and bone grafting is curative in >80% of cases. Local recurrence rates of ≤38% have been reported, most often because of inadequate resection, and have been associated with malignant conversion and metastasis. Adjuvant therapies can help minimize the incidence of local recurrence. Long-term follow-up examinations are recommended, given the protracted interval that can exist between recurrence and the potential for malignant conversion and metastasis. We present the case of a young, healthy, active male with a calcaneal chondroblastoma and associated pathologic fracture whose initial treatment consisted of curettage, hydrogen peroxide lavage, and allogeneic bone grafting. Recurrence developed at 15 months postoperatively and was treated with repeat curettage, high-speed burring, and reconstruction with steel Steinman pins and polymethylmethacrylate, resulting in no pain or recurrence at the 5-month follow-up point.",

		"abstract": "Chondroblastoma has a predilection for the epiphyses or apophyses of long tubular bones. Management of lesions in the proximal tibia is challenging because it is difficult to gain access to intraepiphyseal lesions for completion of curettage. From October 2007 to December 2011, 9 patients with de novo chondroblastoma of the proximal tibia underwent surgery at the authors' institution. All patients initially presented with pain, and 5 patients had limitation of range of motion of the ipsilateral knee. Four lesions abutted the tibial attachment sites of the cruciate ligaments. Surgical procedures included intralesional tumor curettage, additional burring, and packing of the defect with bone graft and/or bone cement. The extra-articular approach was used according to tumor location. The medial or lateral parapatellar approach was used when the tumor was located in the anterior two-thirds of the horizontal plane. When a lesion was located in the posterior third, the posteromedial or posterolateral approach was used as the lesion was cornered. Mean duration of follow-up was 47.2 months (range, 27-80 months). No local recurrence or pulmonary metastasis was noted at latest follow-up. Mean functional score was 29.3 points (range, 28-30 points). All patients fully recovered range of motion in the affected knee. No avulsion fracture or anteroposterior instability of the knee joint was detected. Results of the current study suggest that intralesion curettage followed by additional burring with an extra-articular approach is a successful treatment option for chondroblastoma of the proximal tibia.",

In the past, treatment for chondroblastoma has been highly variable leading to different rates of recurrences. Therefore we aimed to determine: (1) the rate of recurrence, (2) the complication rate, (3) and functional outcome after intralesional curettage of chondroblastoma.\nHypotheses\nIntralesional curettage with high speed burring and packing can avoid local recurrences.\nPatients and methods\nExperiences of 22 patients with chondroblastoma of the bone were retrospectively reviewed. The patient group consisted of 16 men; 6 women; mean age 24years (range; 12–58years) affecting in 15 the lower- (68%) and in seven the upper extremity (32%).\nResults\nThere was no local recurrence or malignant transformation.

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: Chondroblastoma (CB) is a rare benign tumor that occurs most commonly in the second decade of life. No studies on CB in adulthood have been reported. Our purposes were to report a single-institution experience on CB in adults and to discuss the clinical and imaging findings, type of treatment, oncologic and functional outcomes.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients diagnosed and treated for CB from 1981 to 2014 were reviewed. The main inclusion criterion was patients above their 30 years of age at diagnosis. Clinical presentation, imaging, surgical treatment, complications and functional outcome were evaluated. Local recurrences were recorded.\nRESULTS: There were 15 males (65%) and 8 females (35%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 30-59 years). Tumor involved the small bones (talus, calcaneus, acromion, cuneiform, metatarsals) in 15 patients (65%) and the long bones in eight patients (35%). Treatment consisted of curettage only (6 cases), curettage plus phenol (13 cases), curettage plus radiotherapy (one patient with vertebral tumor), resection (two patients with CB of the acromion) and chopart amputation (one patient with a metatarsal tumor). At a mean follow-up of 8.4 years (range 3-30 years), twenty patients (87%) remained continuously disease-free, whereas three had local recurrences. None of the patients received chemotherapy.\nCONCLUSION: This study confirms that the occurrence and outcome of adult patients with CB are similar with those affecting younger patients. The main difference consists of the involved bones; flat bones and short tubular bones of the foot, especially the talus and calcaneus, are most commonly involved as opposed to long tubular bones.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, level IV-1 (case series).",

		"abstract": "Background\nChondroblastoma is a rare benign cartilaginous tumor, which primarily occurs in children and adolescents. Chondroblastoma commonly originates in the epiphyseal plate of long bones. An aggressive curettage treatment is recommended to manage lesion, which may jeopardize an open epiphyseal plate and result in limb shortening and deformity as the limb grows and develops. The purpose is to observe surgical effects of chondroblastoma on open epiphyseal plate of long bones in children and adolescents and explore influences on limb growth and development.\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively reviewed 18 cases of long bone chondroblastoma with open epiphyseal growth plate during March 2004 to October 2010 in our center. Seven females and 11 males with mean age of 11.6 ± 2.0 years old (8–15 years) were included. Patients, who suffered from trauma and pathological fracture of the epiphyseal plate or congenital diseases such as poliomyelitis, congenital dementia, and cartilage malnutrition, were excluded. All patients were treated with meticulous intralesional curettage and inactivity with alcohol followed by bone grafts. All cases were followed up 8.2 ± 1.7 years (5–11.5 years).\n\nResults\nAll had no local recurrence and distance metastasis. The length of the affected limb was short, 18.47 ± 7.22 mm (1.5–30 mm). There was no obvious relativity with tumor activity (P = 0.061). Meanwhile, there were obvious relativity with the greatest dimension of the lesion (TGD) (P = 0.003), the vertical dimension between edge of lesion and epiphyseal line (TVD) (P = 0.010), and area ratio of lesion to local epiphysis (lesion/growth plate) (P = 0.015). The MSTS93 (Revised Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Rating Scale 93) and SF-36 (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) had been significantly improved (P < 0.01).\n\nConclusion\nManaging of chondroblastoma located in open epiphyseal plate of a long bone with meticulous curettage, inactivity, and bone grafts can control tumor progression and recurrence effectively. Meanwhile, early detection and prompt surgical treatment intervention, which reduced significantly the tumor to influence limb growth and development, get encouraging limb function.\n\nTrial registration\nThis is a retrospective study, which was not registered in any trial registry.",

		"abstract": "Background\nBenign bone tumors and tumor-like conditions are commonly located in the proximal femur. The main indications for surgical treatment are lesions with impending or actual pathological fractures, or with aggressive or recurrent lesions. However, patients complaining of persistent pain, limping, or abnormal gait patterns are also considered for surgical treatment. In this study, we describe the outcomes of the surgical treatment of benign lytic lesions of the proximal femur by curettage followed by implantation of synthetic bone graft.\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective study included 27 patients (22 females and 5 males) with benign lytic lesions of the proximal femur. The average age was 25.5 years (6–65 years), and the mean follow-up period was 54.5 months (9–145 months). The histopathological diagnoses were fibrous dysplasia (8 patients), simple bone cyst (8 patients), chondroblastoma (7 patients), giant cell tumor (3 patients), and eosinophilic granuloma (1 patient). These lesions were managed with curettage followed by implantation of the bone defects with alpha tricalcium phosphate in 14 patients, beta tricalcium phosphate granules in 11 patients, hydroxyapatite granules in 1 patient, and combined beta tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite granules in 1 patient. Internal fixation was performed in three patients.\n\nResults\nThe mean operative time was 143 min (80–245 min). Patients had regained normal unrestricted activity without pain at the operation site. Patients treated with beta tricalcium phosphate achieved radiographic consolidation of the bone defects within 1 year after the surgery, and those treated with alpha tricalcium phosphate or hydroxyapatite experienced no progression nor recurrence of the lesions. Local tumor recurrence was observed in one patient with giant cell tumor 5 years after the surgery. Post-operative pathological fracture was occurred in one patient with a simple bone cyst of the subtrochanteric region 1 month after surgery. No post-operative infection was observed.\n\nConclusion\nWe concluded that the treatment of benign lytic lesions of the proximal femur, either primary or recurrent, using synthetic bone graft is a safe and satisfactory method and the addition of internal fixation should be carefully planned.",

Brown tumor is a rare bone lesion, incidence less than 5% in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is more common in secondary hyperparathyroidism with up to 13% of cases. Brown tumor reactive lesion forms as a result of disturbed bone remodeling due to long standing increase in parathyroid hormones. Cervical spine involvement is extremely rare, can be confused with serous spine lesions. To date, only four cases of cervical spine involvement have been reported. Three were due to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Only one was reported to involve the axis and was due to secondary hyperparathyroidism. This is the first reported case of axis brown tumor due to primary hyperparathyroidism. A case report of brown tumor is presented. A literature review was conducted by a Medline search of reported cases of brown tumor, key words: brown tumor, osteoclastoma and cervical lesions. The resulting papers were reviewed and cervical spine cases were listed then classified according to the level, cause, and management. Only four previous cases involved the cervical spine. Three were caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism and one was by primary hyperparathyroidism which involved the C6. Our case was the first case of C2 involvement of primary hyperparathyroidism and it was managed conservatively. Brown tumor, a rare spinal tumor that presents with high PTH and giant cells, requires a high level of suspicion.",

		"abstract": "Aims and Objective\nTo evaluate the prevalence, clinical features, diagnostic laboratory values and treatment outcome of giant cell lesions (brown tumors) associated with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in oral and maxillofacial region.\n\nStudy Design\nA 5 year retrospective data was analyzed wherein all histopathologically proven cases of giant cell lesions involving oral and maxillofacial region were evaluated. Out of these cases, those associated with PHPT were tabulated. Correlation was established with other concomitant clinical features and also with the laboratory values of altered serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphate and parathormone. Follow up of these cases after the correction of PHPT was also noted.\n\nResult\nOut of 85 cases of histopathologically proven giant cell lesions, five cases were associated with PHPT. There was involvement of maxilla and mandible in one case each. Only frontal bone was involved in two cases. Fifth case had multiple lytic lesions in maxilla and frontal bone. All patients consistently showed very high values of alkaline phosphate and parathormone. Hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia was noted in four cases. All cases showed regression of the lytic lesion after parathyroidectomy obviating the need for surgical excision of the jaw lesions.\n\nConclusion\nGiant cell lesions (brown tumors) associated with PHPT in oral and maxillofacial region are rare clinical entities. The prevalence of PHPT associated giant cell lesions is 5.9 %. They are clinically, radiologically and histopathologically similar to any other peripheral or central giant cell tumor. Relevant history may alert the clinician and altered biochemical values may help in correlating the oral and maxillofacial findings with the underlying systemic disease. At times, the brown tumor maybe the only presenting sign leading to the diagnosis of PHPT.",

As osteoclast is activated to stimulate reabsorption and fibrosis of bone, it causes a cystic change of the bone. Parathyroid carcinoma is being reported as a tumor that induces primary hyperparathyroidism. It causes excessive secretion of the parathyroid hormone and increases the blood parathyroid hormone and calcium. Bone deformation due to brown tumor is known to be naturally recovered through the treatment for hyperparathyroidism. However, there is no clearly defined treatment for lesions that can induce pathological fractures developing in lower extremities. We experienced a case where brown tumor developed in the proximal femur of a 57-year-old female patient due to parathyroid carcinoma. In this case, spontaneous fracture occurred without any trauma, and it was cured by performing intramedullary nailing fixation and parathyroidectomy. We report the treatment results along with a literature review.",

		"abstract": "A cortical lesion of the tibial diaphysis in a young patient poses a diagnostic challenge to the clinician. Brown tumors, although not very common, may mimic malignancies on radiographs. Brown tumors are destructive lytic lesions of the bone due to increased osteoclastic activity and fibroblastic proliferation in patients with uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism (HPT). They occur after primary or secondary HPT due to renal failure but very rarely due to vitamin D deficiency. We report a rare case of a brown tumor of tibial diaphyses in a young female patient mimicking a locally aggressive tumor with secondary HPT due to a severe vitamin D deficiency. The effect of hyperparathyroidism on bone metabolism is clinically worse in the presence of vitamin D deficiency and, hence, it predisposes patients to brown tumors that can affect any bone in the body. They can be managed conservatively but may require prophylactic fixation in particular cases.",

		"abstract": "Background\nBrown tumors represent a rare clinical manifestation reported in approximately 3% of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and correspond to radiologically osteolytic lesions with well-defined borders in different parts of the skeleton.\n\nCase presentation\nWe report the case of a 53-year-old white man who presented to our hospital with osteolytic lesions of his distal ulna and radius, causing pain and swelling of 2-month duration. A subsequent biopsy revealed histological features consistent with giant cell tumor and a complete resection of his distal ulna was followed, along with curettage and cementoplasty of the distal radial metaphysis. Two weeks later, he was re-admitted with diffuse musculoskeletal soreness, anorexia, constipation, nausea, and localized abdominal pain and multiple osteolytic lesions on plain radiographs. A histopathological examination of the ulna and radius specimens showed similar findings and, given the multifocality, brown tumors related to primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism was included in the differential diagnosis. A laboratory examination showed high total serum calcium (14.5 mg/dl) and low serum phosphorus and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Primary hyperparathyroidism was suspected and confirmed by the elevated parathyroid hormone levels of 1453 pg/mL. At radiological work-up, using computed tomography, ultrasonography, and parathyroid subtraction technetium-99m sestamibi scintigraphy, a 4.5 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm mass emanating from the right lobe of his thyroid gland was detected, displaying extensive uptake in the right lower parathyroid gland. After appropriate medical support including hyperhydration and high doses of diuretics and diphosphonates, his laboratory profile normalized and he underwent total thyroidectomy with removal of the parathyroid glands. Our patient is now recovering 12 months after surgery, with normal values of serum parathyroid hormone and calcium levels. The lytic bone lesions have almost disappeared and no other additional orthopedic intervention was necessary.\n\nConclusions\nThe present case report emphasizes the need of inclusion of brown tumors in the differential diagnosis of multifocal osteolytic bone lesions, in order to avoid harmful surgical interventions. Laboratory testing of serum phosphate, calcium levels, and parathyroid hormone levels should always be included in the routine survey of patients with multifocal osteolytic lesions.",

On imaging with plain radiographs, CT, and MRI, this expansile lucent lesion with solid internal enhancement had an appearance that overlapped with metastasis or brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism.

		"abstract": "We report a 48-year-old Japanese man with a brown tumor of the right distal tibia. At the age of 25 years, hemodialysis was initiated due to nail-patella syndrome. Severe secondary hyperparathyroidism and osteoporosis progressed over time, so parathyroidectomy was performed at age 45. Spontaneous fracture of the right distal tibia occurred suddenly at age 48. Imaging studies revealed a bone tumor-like lesion and surgery was performed. The resected specimen was a brown mass consisting of multinucleated giant cells on a fibrous tissue background, and these findings were consistent with a diagnosis of brown tumor. Immunohistochemistry revealed that multinucleated giant cells near areas of bone matrix were positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and cathepsin K, but the majority of the giant cells in the lesion were negative for these markers. Even after parathyroidectomy, brown tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bone tumor-like lesions in patients on long-term dialysis. This case suggests that osteoclast activation may not contribute to development of brown tumors, although these lesions are generally considered to arise from subperiosteal bone resorption related to osteoclast overactivity in patients with hyperparathyroidism.",

The MRT produced the diagnosis of an aneurismal bone cyst, in which the presence of juvenile bone cyst or a giant cell tumor could be taken into consideration by differential diagnosis.Owing to the pathological fracture, repair by operation of the lesion was carried out by means of spongioplastic surgery and internal fixation (DHS).\nCONCLUSION: Histology produced characteristic findings fitting the condition of fibrous dysplasia, which was not included among the primary causes in the considerations offered by differential diagnosis.Therefore, this case is a good example of the fact that fibrous dysplasia must be taken into account when using differential diagnosis as one of the cystic lesions.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: A unicameral bone cyst (UBC) may be caused by an intraosseous venous obstruction with the accumulation of interstitial fluid. Therefore, continuous decompression of the fluid using cannulated screws would represent a causal therapeutic approach.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical and radiographic follow-up of 17 patients with UBCs treated by curettage and mechanical decompression using cannulated screws was evaluated retrospectively.\nRESULTS: Radiographic examination revealed the following results: complete healing of the lesion (n=2), persistent defect after healing (n=6), persistent lesion (n=6), and recurrent cyst after temporary remodeling (n=3). No pathologic fracture was subsequently observed in the group of lesions that had a persistent defect after healing. A persistent lesion occurred in the proximal femur in 75% of the cases and in the proximal humerus in 50% of the cases.\nCONCLUSION: Continuous decompression using cannulated screws can be applied in UBCs of the proximal humerus in patients with recurrent fractures and subjective complaints. However, treatment failures are common and comparable to other therapeutic approaches. Therefore, conservative treatment must be discussed critically. Healing with residual defect must be regarded as a good treatment result, and additional operative procedures with the objective of radiographic cosmetics should not be done. Because of poor results and long-term disability related to weight bearing, treatment of UBCs with cannulated screws cannot be recommended in lesions located in the proximal femur. In these cases, immediate surgical stabilization is the appropriate procedure.",

		"abstract": "Background\nUnicameral (or simple) bone cysts (UBC) are benign tumours most often located in long bones of children and adolescents. Pathological fractures are common, and due to high recurrence rates, these lesions remain a challenge to treat. Numerous surgical procedures have been proposed, but there is no general consensus of the ideal treatment. The aim of this investigation therefore was to study the long-term outcome after surgical treatment in UBC.\n\nMethods\nA retrospective analysis of 46 patients surgically treated for UBC was performed for short and mid-term outcome. Clinical and radiological outcome parameters were studied according to a modified Neer classification system. Long-term clinical information was retrieved via a questionnaire at a minimum follow-up of 10 years after surgery.\n\nResults\nForty-six patients (17 female, 29 male) with a mean age of 10.0 ± 4.8 years and with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of UBC were included. Pathological fractures were observed in 21 cases (46%). All patients underwent surgery for UBC (35 patients underwent curettage and bone grafting as a primary therapy, 4 curettage alone, 3 received corticoid instillation and 4 decompression by cannulated screws). Overall recurrence rate after the first surgical treatment was 39% (18/46), second (17.4% of all patients) and third recurrence (4.3%) were frequently observed and were addressed by revision surgery. Recurrence was significantly higher in young and in male patients as well as in active cysts. After a mean of 52 months, 40 out of 46 cysts were considered healed. Prognosis was significantly better when recurrence was observed later than 30 months after therapy. After a mean follow-up of 15.5 ± 6.2 years, 40 patients acknowledged clinically excellent results, while five reported mild and casual pain. Only one patient reported a mild limitation of range of motion.\n\nConclusions\nOur results suggest satisfactory overall long-term outcome for the surgical treatment of UBC, although short-and mid-term observation show a considerable rate of recurrence independent of the surgical technique.",

		"abstract": "Simple bone cysts (SBCs) are benign bone tumors. However, the treatment of SBCs remains controversial because of their healing rate and the invasiveness of surgery. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the treatment of SBCs using a cannulated hydroxyapatite (HA) pin., A total of 43 patients (35 males, 8 females; mean age 12.1 years; age range, 5–22 years) with SBCs were treated with continuous decompression by inserting ceramic HA pins between 1989 and 2014. The SBCs were located in the calcaneus in 23, the humerus in 15, the femur in 3, and the pelvis in 2 cases. In all patients, minimal fenestration of the cyst wall and curettage and multiple drilling in the cyst wall were performed, followed by insertion of the HA pin. The mean follow-up period was 26.6 months. Operating time, healing period, risk factors for recurrence, and the cure rate were evaluated., Healing was achieved without intervention in 38 patients after a mean of 6.4 months. Two patients had persistent small residual cysts, which had no changes after 1 year at the latest follow-up. There were 5 patients with recurrences (humerus 4, femur 1), who were cured by curettage and artificial bone grafting. The final healing rate by cannulation only using an HA pin was 88.2%. On Fisher exact test, age, site of SBCs, and distance from the physis were found to be significantly associated with SBC recurrence (P < 0.05)., In the present study, cannulation using an HA pin for SBCs was found to be a useful technique, particularly for calcaneal cysts, because it is a minimally invasive procedure with a high cure rate. In patients <10 years, involvement of the humerus and contact with the growth plate were significant risk factors for SBC recurrence.",

		"abstract": "Background\nEndoscopic curettage is considered applicable for the treatment of simple bone cysts with the expectation that it might be less invasive than open curettage. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of endoscopic curettage for the treatment of simple bone cysts. The goal was to investigate the incidence of cyst recurrence and bone healing after endoscopic curettage. Moreover, complications and functionality at the final follow-up were evaluated.\n\nMethods\nFrom 2003 to 2014, 37 patients with simple bone cysts underwent endoscopic curettage. Twenty-four were male and 13 were female, with a mean age of 14.7 years. Endoscopic curettage was performed with the support of an arthroscope via 7–8 mm holes penetrated by cannulated drills with a small incision. The cysts underwent curettage using angled curettes, rongeurs, and an electrical shaver until the normal bone was observed in the medullary cavity. To investigate the bone healing after endoscopic curettage, we evaluated the consolidation of the cyst at the final evaluation (Modified Neer Classification) and the time to solid union after operation, which was defined as the sufficient thickness of the cortical bone to prevent fracture and allow physical activities.\n\nResults\nRecurrence occurred in seven patients (18.9%). A log-rank analysis revealed that contact with the physis was associated with recurrence (p = 0.006). Among 31 patients (83.7%), the consolidation of cyst was considered healed at the final X-ray follow-up period, and in these patients, the mean time taken for solid union of cortical bone thinning was 4.0 months (standard deviation, 2.4). With regard to major complications of endoscopic curettage, a transient radial nerve palsy and two postoperative fractures occurred. The former problem was managed conservatively and the latter problems by transient internal fixation; these problems were managed without any further complications. All patients had a good postoperative function.\n\nConclusions\nEndoscopic curettage might be a useful alternative as it is a minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of simple bone cysts. Considering the relatively smaller size of this study, further investigation should be necessary for deducing the reliable conclusion.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The potential unrevealed clinicopathological differences between simple bone cysts situated in the calcaneus (calcaneal bone cysts) and those situated in long bones (long bone cysts) were investigated in the present study.\nMETHODS: A total of 41 cysts from 41 patients who underwent operative treatment were evaluated: 16 cysts in the calcaneus, 17 in the humerus, 7 in the femur, and 1 in the tibia. The clinical course, radiological findings, and histological features were retrospectively reviewed.\nRESULTS: The mean patient age was 11.5 years (range, 3 to 25 years), and the mean follow-up was 33.0 months (range, 12 to 77 months). The mean patient age was significantly higher in patients with calcaneal bone cysts (13.5 years; long bone cysts, 10.2 years, P < .05). No treatment failure was seen for patients with calcaneal bone cysts, while 7 long bone cysts required reoperation. In H&E-stained specimens of the cyst wall, cholesterol clefts were identified in 10 of the 16 calcaneal bone cysts (62.5%), whereas none were identified in long bone cysts (0%; P < .0001).\nCONCLUSION: Our study elucidates the different clinicopathological features existing between calcaneal bone cysts and long bone cysts. Cholesterol clefting is most likely due to hemorrhaging and the subsequent breakdown of blood in the cyst. The significance of these differences between long bone and calcaneal cysts is still open to conjecture.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative series.",

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the calcaneus differentiation between a solitary cyst and intraosseus lipoma is difficult. Radiologists frequently diagnose an intraosseus lipoma, whereas histology shows the classical signs of a solitary bone cyst. We present 12 cases of a solitary cyst of the calcaneus.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1993 and 2001 we operated on 12 patients (8 men, 4 women, median age 28 +/- 14 years) with calcaneal cysts. 9 patients received a curretage and an autologous, one patient a homologous, one patient a mixed autologous-homologous bone-grafting and one patient only a curretage (due to the small diameter of the cyst) of their cysts.\nRESULTS: No case revealed the histological picture of a fatty formation, which appears to be typical for an intraosseus lipoma. All of the microscopic findings resembled the characteristics seen in cysts of the long bones. A pathological fracture has not been observed.\nCONCLUSION: The histologically confirmed calcaneal cysts showed the radiological signs that are supposed to be typical for an intraosseous lipoma. It cannot be decided whether the histologically diagnosed calcaneal lipomas described by others can be interpreted as fatty degeneration of a calcaneal cyst, or whether fatty areas of the bone marrow have given a wrong impression. Since the literature only describes single isolated cases of a pathological fracture of the calcaneal cyst or lipoma, asymptomatic patients should be treated non-operatively.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the common imaging features of intraosseous lipomas on radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), and review their histological features.\nDESIGN AND PATIENTS: Thirty-five previously unreported cases of intraosseous lipoma were reviewed and a meta-analysis was performed of another 110 cases identified from the English language literature.\nRESULTS: The mean age at presentation is 43 years. Sex distribution is nearly equal. Lipomas occur most frequently in the lower limb (71% overall), particularly in the os calcis (32%). Other common sites include the metaphyses of long bones, where lesions are typically eccentric. Lipomas are usually well defined, but marginal sclerosis is commoner in lesions of the os calcis (61%) than at other sites (38%). Calcification is also more frequent in the os calcis (62%), and almost invariably centrally located. Calcification at other sites is less common (30%), and is more variable in appearance. Bone expansion is less common (30%), and usually minimal. Fat necrosis and cyst formation identified on MRI is common (67%), and more frequent in the os calcis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although there is correlation between the histological and radiological features of intraosseous lipomas in general, some discrepancies occur in the radiological appearances of lipomas in different sites. The evidence that these lesions are true benign tumours of fat is controversial. Several aetiological factors have been implicated in their development. The constant location of os calcis lesions at the critical angle suggests an aetiology that may be related to biomechanical lines of stress. In other instances it is possible that involution of pre-existing lesions may lead to the development of lipomas.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of minimally invasive surgery to control cyst progression for active unicameral bone cysts (AUBC) by intracystic methylprednisolone injection, percutaneous curettage, and autogenous bone marrow grafting.\nMETHODS: From May 2010 to May 2017, patients diagnosed with AUBC who underwent percutaneous double-needle intracystic methylprednisolone injection, percutaneous curettage, and autogenous bone marrow grafting were retrospectively reviewed. Recurrence was defined by modified Neer scale score. Patients were followed up regularly, and previous imaging findings were compared to evaluate treatment efficacy.\nRESULTS: The 26 patients (17 boys, 9 girls, mean age, 9.4 ± 3.1 years) were followed up for a mean 45.1 months (range, 24-82 months). Follow-up consisted of clinical evaluation and radiographic review. Twenty patients (77%) achieved latent disease stage after the first treatment, while six (23%) achieved it after the second treatment. Postoperative pathological fracture imaging scores were score I in 18 (70%), score II in five (19%), score III in two (8%), and score IV in one patient (4%). All 26 patients returned to their full activities and were asymptomatic at the most recent follow-up. The success rate (scores I and II) independent of the number of treatments was 89%. Treatment time was correlated with cyst size and length. Sex, age, cyst location and size, pathological fracture, and other clinical factors or radiological data did not influence the curative effect. No other complications occurred.\nCONCLUSIONS: For AUBC, minimally invasive treatment is feasible to control cyst progression and then cure it without sequelae. Intracystic methylprednisolone injection, percutaneous curettage, and autogenous bone marrow grafting are an excellent choice.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of fractures on pathologic bone in healing of proximal humerus unicameral bone cysts (UBCs) and investigate the clinical factors that affect healing of UBCs after fractures on pathologic bone.\nMETHODS: This prospective study was carried out between 2002 and 2014. We evaluated 56 patients with a UBC accompanying fractures on pathologic bone in the proximal humerus. Clinical data were collected from the patients' medical records. Age, gender, degree of fracture displacement, location of cyst, and cyst size were investigated, and we assessed how these factors affected cyst healing.\nRESULTS: The overall healing rate of UBCs 1 year after fracture was 66% (37 of 56 cases). The healing rate was significantly lower in pubescent patients (10-14 years old; 45%) than in those who were 9 years old (76%) or 15 years old (80%). The rate of healing of fractures in the metaphysis (53%) was lower than that of breaks in the diaphysis (85%). The mean cyst ratio was 1.31 in the 37 patients who experienced cyst healing within 1 year and 1.79 in the 19 patients who needed surgical treatment within 1 year.\nCONCLUSION: In latent lesions and in patients who are older (after puberty), UBCs of the humerus after fracture have better clinical results than do active lesions and those in younger patients (before puberty). Fractures on pathologic bone in proximal humerus UBCs often dramatically decrease cyst size, and patients with such fractures have excellent clinical results in terms of healing rate.",

		"abstract": "Osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD) and adamantinoma are rare and most commonly arise in the tibia of young individuals. Although OFD has typical histopathologic features, areas resembling OFD have often been noted at the periphery of otherwise classic adamantinomas, and some have suggested that OFD may be either a precursor to or a regressive phase of adamantinoma. The so-called OFD-like adamantinoma encompasses some features of both OFD and adamantinoma. We studied the clinical, imaging, histopathologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular features of 16 OFD and 8 adamantinomas (5 OFD-like and 3 classic) in an attempt to further define their morphology, clinical course, and relationship. Patients with OFD were generally younger than those with adamantinoma. Osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity was more prominent in OFD than in OFD-like adamantinoma. In addition to the inconspicuous small clusters of epithelial cells in OFD-like adamantinoma, isolated keratin-positive cells with a unique ultrastructural hybrid fibroblastic-epithelial phenotype were found in the stroma of all OFD and OFD-like adamantinomas. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed trisomies 7, 8, and/or 12 in the spindle cell stroma of OFD, OFD-like, and classic adamantinoma, supporting a neoplastic origin of OFD and a common histogenesis for all 3 lesions. Trisomies were not observed in osteoblasts or osteoclasts suggesting that the osseous component is reactive and non-neoplastic. Of the 11 OFD patients with follow-up (median, 4.5 y), all 3 who underwent incisional biopsy had persistent, nonprogressive disease and 2 of 8 who underwent curettage or wide excision had recurrence; none developed adamantinoma. All 6 adamantinoma patients with follow-up (3 classic and 3 OFD-like) were treated with wide excision. One with classic adamantinoma died of pulmonary metastases 9 years after presentation; the other 5 were free of disease with a median follow-up of 12 years. None of the classic adamantinomas evolved into OFD-like adamantinoma or OFD. Although the histopathology, immunohistochemistry, ultrastructure, and cytogenetics indicate that these lesions are closely related, our data and the literature suggest that only classic adamantinoma has malignant potential. OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma, and classic adamantinoma appear to show a progressive complexity of cytogenetic aberrations, perhaps indicative of a multistep neoplastic transformation.",

Histological examination revealed a high grade spindle cell sarcoma involving some areas of cytokeratine positive cells. Ultrastructural examination showed the presence of epithelial features in the sarcomatoid cells. The diagnosis of dedifferentiated spindle-celled adamantinoma was established. A second lesion of the right tibia was diagnosed as fibrous dysplasia. The patient had a leg amputation. He died 2 years later with multiple lung and bone metastases. The diagnosis of dedifferentiated adamantinoma should be considered when a clinician is confronted with a tibial biopsy of a “keratin-positive sarcoma”. The association with fibrous dysplasia in this case is discussed.",

		"abstract": "Summary\nThe Ewing-like variation of adamantinoma is a rare entity, leading to challenge its differential diagnosis, notably with Ewing's sarcoma. We are reporting a case of a 20-year-old male who presented with swelling in the left leg that had progressed over a 2-year period. X-rays revealed a tumour in the tibia that was intracortical, osteolytic, multilocular and invaded the soft tissues. A surgical biopsy was performed. Histopathology examination showed a tumour growth with small round cells expressing CD99. A diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma was made. Since the patient declined surgical treatment, chemotherapy was administered. Two years later, the patient returned because the tumour had grown in size. A second biopsy was performed. Microscopic evaluation showed a tumour growth with osteofibrous and epithelial components, which expressed pankeratin and vimentin, but was negative for CD99. A diagnosis of Ewing-like adamantinoma was made.",

		"abstract": "Adamantinoma is a low-grade, malignant biphasic bone tumour predominantly located in the tibia. In up to 50% of all cases this is combined with one or more lesions in the ipsilateral fibula. Whether these lesions represent regional metastases or arise de novo is not yet exactly known. In order to address this question, we extracted DNA from the respective fresh frozen tumour tissues in a case of a young woman with a multifocal adamantinoma of both the tibia and ipsilateral fibula. Afterwards the X inactivation pattern was studied by means of methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction and primers that target the polymorphic CGG trinucleotide repeat of FMR1 gene and the polymorphic CAG repeat, on exon 1 of the human androgen receptor gene (AR). The analysis of the AR was homozygous and not informative. Studying the FMR1 gene, we detected a 100% skewing of the X inactivation pattern of both locations and found that the same allele was methylated. Even if the fibula lesion arose de novo there would have been a 50 : 50 chance that the same allele was methylated. As this methylation pattern was found we cannot provide a valid explanation for the origin of the fibula lesion. Analysis of X inactivation patterns in future cases of polyfocal adamantinoma might provide further evidence for one of the two theories.",

		"abstract": "Reconstruction with massive bone allograft and autologous vascularised fibula combines the structural strength of the allograft and the advantages of fibula's intrinsic blood supply. We retrospectively analysed the outcome of twelve patients (4 male, 8 female) who received reconstruction with massive bone allograft and autologous vascularised fibula after tumour resection in lower limb. Mean age was 17.8 years (range 11–31 years), with following primaries: Ewing's sarcoma (n = 6), osteosarcoma (n = 4), liposarcoma grade 2 (n = 1), and adamantinoma (n = 1). Mean followup was 38.7 months (median 25.7 months; range 2–88 months). Seven tumours were located in the femur and five in the tibia. The mean length of bone defect was 18.7 cm (range 15–25 cm). None of the grafts had to be removed, but there occurred four fractures, four nonunions, and two infections. Two patients developed donor side complication, in form of flexion deformity of the big toe. The event-free survival rate was 51% at two-year followup and 39% at three- and five-year followup. As the complications were manageable, and full weight bearing was achieved in all cases, we consider the combination of massive bone allograft and autologous vascularised fibula a stable and durable reconstruction method of the diaphysis of the lower limbs.",

However, given the degree of overlap of imaging findings and variation in management of various sub-types, it is a widely accepted practice to perform a biopsy to obtain histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis. The following is a summary of the epidemiology, clinicopathological features, and review of the imaging features of fibro-osseous lesions, including osteofibrous dysplasia, osteofibrous dysplasia-like adamantinoma, adamantinoma, and lesions that closely mimic them. The illustrated examples are histologically proven cases that were presented to a tertiary referral teaching hospital and national bone and soft-tissue tumours unit.

		"abstract": "AIMS: The aim of this study was to identify any progression between benign osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD), OFD-like adamantinoma and malignant adamantinoma, and to investigate the rates of local recurrence, metastases and survival, in order to develop treatment algorithms for each.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A single institution retrospective review of all patients presenting with OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma between 1973 and 2012 was undertaken. Complete data were available for 73 patients (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma). The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0 to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.\nRESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5 years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma. A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required any treatment and have been managed with observation. A total of 18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage and five with resection. In all, three patients developed recurrence following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these patients were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six patients initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten patients initially diagnosed with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were managed with observation alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with resection. Local recurrence arose in two patients, one each after curettage and resection. No patients with either OFD or an OFD-like adamantinoma developed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma. All patients with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision. In all, two of the three treated with curettage developed local recurrence, requiring further surgery. Late development of both local recurrence and metastases led to a ten year disease specific survival of 93% which had dropped to 39% by 20 years.\nCONCLUSION: We found no evidence of progression from OFD to adamantinoma. Conservative management with observation or curettage is often successful for patients with OFD and OFD-like adamantinoma. Resection with clear margins is required for patients with adamantinoma. Late tumour recurrence is not uncommon in adamantinoma and prolonged follow-up should be considered. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2017;99-B:409-16.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The proposed association between osteofibrous dysplasia and adamantinoma has led some to advocate resection of the entire lesion, which can require major subsequent reconstruction. However, this link remains unproven and there is some support in more recent literature for a less aggressive approach. This study aims to describe our experience managing pediatric tibial osteofibrous dysplasia with such an approach and to report functional outcomes in children treated thus.\nMETHODS: A total of 28 cases of osteofibrous dysplasia in 25 patients were managed at a referral center for pediatric bone tumors with observation in the first instance, then limited surgical intervention if required to address pain and deformity. Surgery aimed to restore stability and alignment without excising the lesion. Clinical records provided basic clinical outcome measures involving walking, recreation, orthoses and school/work participation and patients provided a Musculoskeletal Tumour Society score (MSTS) where contactable.\nRESULTS: Mean age at presentation was 6.0 years and mean follow-up was 8.3 years. Only 8 patients required surgery. According to basic outcome measures, 13 patients were symptom-free. About 15 patients (17 cases) provided a MSTS and the mean score was 24 of 30. No transformation to adamantinoma was observed. Those who presented at a younger age and with bilateral disease more often required surgery and remained symptomatic.\nCONCLUSIONS: A less aggressive approach to pediatric tibial osteofibrous dysplasia achieves good functional outcomes and patient satisfaction in most cases. Surgery is required in the minority of cases. Transformation to adamantinoma was not observed in this series. We recommend patient education, clinical observation and reactive intervention if required, rather than proactive resection and reconstruction.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-case series.",

		"abstract": "A dedifferentiated adamantinoma is a rare subtype of an adamantinoma, associated with a relatively aggressive clinical course, with less than 10 such cases reported so far. A 25-year-old-male presented with pain in his right leg of 1-year duration. Imaging disclosed a well-defined lytic, destructive lesion in his proximal tibia with a cortical break and a soft tissue component. Microscopic examination of the biopsy and resected specimen showed nests and clusters of atypical epithelial cells, along with significant areas showing markedly pleomorphic and spindly sarcomatous cells with interspersed mitotic figures and areas of stromal hyalinization. By immunohistochemistry, the areas of epithelial differentiation showed intense positivity for cytokeratin and p63, whereas the sarcomatous areas showed reduced to absent immunostaining. A 51-year-old lady presented with a recurrent tumor in her right tibia, which was initially diagnosed as an adamantinoma, along with metastatic lesions in her lung. Microscopic examination of the recurrent and metastatic tumors showed areas of epithelial differentiation along with spindly sarcomatous cells, arranged in fascicles. By immunohistochemistry, the areas of epithelial differentiation showed positivity for pan cytokeratin. Additionally, p63 was diffusely positive. p53 showed diffuse and intense staining pattern in the sarcomatous component (dedifferentiation). While the first case is disease-free, the second case is on follow-up. The 2 cases of dedifferentiated adamantinoma further confirm the rare occurrence of this tumor in our population. Its correct diagnosis has treatment implications. Differential diagnoses and literature review of similar reported cases are also presented in this article.",

		"abstract": "Adamantinoma of the long bones is a rare, typically low-grade malignant tumor that frequently involves the tibia. Radiographically, adamantinoma is characteristically a lytic, intracortical, and expansile lesion with variable margins. Histologically, adamantinoma is a bimorphic neoplasm, composed of epithelial and osteofibrous elements. Herein, we describe a 72-year-old man with a long-standing tibial mass that, on imaging, rapidly developed cortical destruction with soft tissue extension. Imaging revealed no evidence of a distant site of origin. Needle core biopsy demonstrated high-grade squamous cell carcinoma, and metastasis was initially favored. However, the combined clinicoradiologic and pathologic features were most compatible with a high-grade squamous cell carcinoma arising in adamantinoma. The diagnosis was confirmed in the resection specimen. Both the age at presentation and histologic features make this case unusual and highlight a potential for misdiagnosis in the evaluation of squamous cell carcinoma-containing lesions of the tibia, reinforcing the importance of clinicoradiologic correlation in bone pathology.",

		"abstract": "Background\nPatients often receive advanced imaging before referral to an orthopaedic oncologist. The few studies that have evaluated the value of these tests have been single-center studies, and there were large discrepancies in the estimated frequencies of unnecessary use of diagnostic tests.\n\nQuestions/purposes\n(1) Is there regional variation in the use of advanced imaging before referral to an orthopaedic oncologist? (2) Are these prereferral studies helpful to the treating orthopaedic oncologist in making a diagnosis or treatment plan? (3) Are orthopaedic surgeons less likely to order unhelpful studies than other specialties? (4) Are there any tumor or patient characteristics that are associated with the ordering of an unhelpful study?\n\nMethods\nWe performed an eight-center prospective analysis of patients referred for evaluation by a fellowship-trained orthopaedic oncologist. We recorded patient factors, referral details, advanced imaging performed, and presumptive diagnosis. The treating orthopaedic oncologist determined whether each study was helpful in the diagnosis or treatment of the patient based on objective and subjective criteria used in prior investigations. We analyzed the data using bivariate methods and logistic regression to determine regional variation and risk factors predictive of unhelpful advanced imaging. Of the 371 participants available for analysis, 301 (81%) were referred with an MRI, CT scan, bone scan, ultrasound, or positron emission tomography scan.\n\nResults\nThere were no regional differences in the use of advanced imaging (range of patients presenting with advanced imaging 66%–88% across centers, p = 0.164). One hundred thirteen patients (30%) had at least one unhelpful study; non-MRI advanced imaging was more likely to be unhelpful than MRIs (88 of 129 [68%] non-MRI imaging versus 46 of 263 [17%] MRIs [p < 0.001]). Orthopaedic surgeons were no less likely than nonorthopaedic surgeons to order unhelpful studies before referral to an orthopaedic oncologist (56 of 179 [31%] of patients referred by orthopaedic surgeons versus 35 of 119 [29%] referred by primary care providers and 22 of 73 [30%] referred by nonorthopaedic specialists, p = 0.940). After controlling for potential confounding variables, benign bone lesions had an increased odds of referral with an unhelpful study (59 of 145 [41%] of benign bone tumors versus 54 of 226 [24%] of soft tissue tumors and malignant bone tumors; odds ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.68–4.69, p < 0.001).\n\nConclusions\nWe found no evidence that the proportion of patients referred with advanced imaging varied dramatically by region. Studies other than MRI were likely to be considered unhelpful and should not be routinely ordered by referring physicians. Diligent education of orthopaedic surgeons and primary care physicians in the judicious use of advanced imaging in benign bone tumors may help mitigate unnecessary imaging.\n\nLevel of Evidence\nLevel III, diagnostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",

		"abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the Enneking staging system for determining the prognosis, planning surgical treatment and indicating adjuvant therapy for benign bone tumors (BBT) and tumor-like bone lesions (TBL). Methods: A retrospective multicenter, descriptive, nonrandomized study was carried out on a representative sample comprising a large series of 165 patients with a total of 168 benign bone tumors and tumor-like bone lesions. The patient sample was typical, and matched the literature in all respects. All the patients were classified according to the Enneking staging system, and the initial staging of each lesion was correlated with its behavior after either conservative or surgical treatment, in order to determine the efficacy of the system. The treatment options and complications were described and analyzed. Results: The results from the treatment provided 95.2% agreement with the Enneking staging system, with a 95% confidence interval of between 90.8 and 97.9%. Of the 168 tumors treated, only eight (4.8%) could not be controlled in relation to the initial treatment indicated by the Enneking staging system. Tumors classified as active were the most prevalent, comprising 73.2% of the lesions. Tumor recurrence was significantly more frequent (p < 0.001) in the aggressive stage. All the patients staged as latent evolved to cure. The study suggested that surgery with wide margins, for aggressive lesions, could provide better lesion control, with a lower recurrence rate (p > 0.001). For latent and active lesions, the study demonstrated the efficacy of both expectant treatment and excision, with or without autogenous bone graft. Conclusion: The results confirm that the Enneking staging system was very efficient in determining the prognosis, enabling surgical planning and indicating adjuvant therapy for treatment of BBT and TBL.",

		"abstract": "Background: Imaging plays an increadinf role in the diagnosis and treatment of back pain and sciatica. The quality of the different imaging modalities had been outlined in recent years and was bound into national guidelines. Purpose of this study is to evaluate, how these guidelines have been adhered to, when and which modality is being used in practice and which factors determine its use. Patients and methods: A total of 100 patients up to the age of 40 with acute lumbar and sciatic pain referred to our hospital for further treatment had been assessed on admission for: the type of imaging procedure already performed, age, sex, symptoms (radicular versus non-radicular), duration and intensity of pain (VAS Score).\nResults: On admission almost all (97 of 100) patients presented with an x-ray of the lumbar spine (ap. and lateral). Surprisingly, a CT of the lumbar spine had been performed significantly more often before admission than an MRI scan (55 versus 29 patients). The factors age, sex, symptoms, duration and intensity of pain did not play a significant role in the decision for CT or MRI.\nConclusion: CT still seems to be used more frequently than MRI on an outpatient prehospital basis for diagnosing acute back pain and sciatica despite the literature showing a clear advantage for MRI, reflected also in the national guidelines. In the light of the current evidence this puts a proportion of the population of childbearing age unnecessarily under the threat of an increased cancer risk. MRI should be the imaging of choice in all cases of recalcitrant back pain and sciatica.",

The radiograph revealed the fracture but also multiple bone lesions. A few years before, the patient had been operated for a maldiagnosed chondrosarcoma of the humeral head. Osteopoikilosis is a rare benign hereditary bone disease, whose mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant. It is usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on radiograph that shows the presence of multiple osteoblastic lesions. It can mimic other bone pathologies, in particular osteoblastic metastases. Osteopoikilosis is a diagnosis that should be kept in mind to avoid misdiagnosis, particularly with regard to cancer metastasis. This disorder does not require any treatment and complications are rare. However, there may be associated anomalies that require follow-up.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoid osteoma is the third most common benign bone tumor and typically induces pain that is worse at night.\nOBJECTIVE: To identify the epidemiological, pathogenetic, histological and radiological characteristics of osteoid osteoma and to present the broad variety of treatment options.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: This review article summarizes relevant clinical studies and meta-analyses on this topic.\nRESULTS: Osteoid osteoma is characterized by a central nidus smaller than 1.5 cm in diameter with surrounding bone sclerosis. In the majority of cases, the tumor occurs in the long bones of the lower extremities and is predominantly manifested in patients aged between 5 and 25 years. Pain is mediated by prostaglandins, which stimulate afferent peripheral nerve fibers. Besides plain radiographs, thin-section computed tomography represents the gold standard of diagnostics but should be complemented by magnetic resonance or nuclear medicine imaging modalities. The conservative treatment consists of long-term therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation of the nidus is the current operative treatment of choice.\nCONCLUSION: Success rates of radiofrequency ablation and other minimally invasive procedures are high while treatment costs and length of hospital stay are low. Thus, open surgical curettage is reserved for rare indications and en bloc excision of the nidus should only be performed in cases of recurrent lesions.",

However, osteoid osteoma may display imaging findings that can be misleading, and it can be difficult to differentiate osteoid osteoma from other conditions such as infection, inflammatory and noninflammatory arthritis, and other tumors. In addition, stress fracture, intracortical abscess, intracortical hemangioma, chondroblastoma, osteoblastoma, and compensatory hypertrophy of the pedicle may mimic osteoid osteoma.

		"abstract": "According to a pathological definition, a bony sequestrum is defined as a piece of devitalized bone that has been separated from the surrounding bone during the process of necrosis. However, the radiological definition of a sequestrum is different and refers to an image of calcification visible within a lucent lesion, completely separated from the surrounding bone, without referring to the vascular status and histological nature of the calcified tissue. The term \"button sequestrum\" has been used in calvarial lesions. The prototype conditions that may present with a bony sequestrum are osteomyelitis and skeletal tuberculosis. Other conditions such as radiation necrosis, eosinophilic granuloma, metastatic carcinoma, primary lymphoma of bone, aggressive fibrous tumors may also manifest as osteolytic lesions containing a sequestrum. In addition, some primary bone tumors produce a matrix that may mineralize and sometimes simulate a bone sequestrum. These include osteoid tumors (osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma), cartilaginous tumors (chondroma and chondroblastoma), lipomatous tumors (lipoma), and benign fibrous tumors (fibromyxoma, myxoma, and desmoplastic fibroma). Therefore, various conditions may present at imaging as a small area of osteolysis containing central calcifications. However, a careful analysis of the sequestrum as well as the associated clinical and radiological findings often enables to point toward a limited number of conditions.",

Radioclinical signs are not specific and the histological diagnosis may be difficult.\nCASE: A 16 year-old male patient consulted for a painless and hard left mandibular swelling, without inferior alveolar nerve disorders. The tumor extended from tooth 31 to tooth 35, the mucosa was healthy. The panoramic view showed a multilocular osteolytic lesion with dental root resorption. CT scan showed expansion of bony cortex with rupture of the outer cortical. The biopsy indicated a desmoplastic fibroma or a fibrosarcoma. A second histological analysis combined with an immuno-histochemical study proved the diagnosis of desmoplastic fibroma.\nDISCUSSION: The desmoplastic fibroma has a polymorphous symptomatology. Radiological signs are unspecific. Anatomopathology combined with immuno-histochemistry can prove the diagnosis and guide the treatment.",

		"abstract": "The benign bone lesions--osteoma, osteoid osteoma, and osteoblastoma--are characterized as bone-forming because tumor cells produce osteoid or mature bone. Osteoma is a slow-growing lesion most commonly seen in the paranasal sinuses and in the calvaria. When it occurs in the long bones, it is invariably juxtacortical and may need to be differentiated from, among others, parosteal osteosarcoma, sessile osteochondroma, and a matured juxtacortical focus of myositis ossificans. Osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma appear histologically very similar. Their clinical presentations and distribution in the skeleton, however, are distinct: osteoid osteoma is usually accompanied by nocturnal pain promptly relieved by salicylates; osteoblastoma arises predominantly in the axial skeleton, spinal lesions constituting one-third of reported cases. This review focuses on the application of the various imaging modalities in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation of these lesions. Their histopathology also is discussed, and their treatment briefly outlined.",

This tumour has been observed infrequently in the diaphysis like the one presented here. An 18-year-old female presented with progressive swelling left arm and dull aching pain for 1 year. She had a bony hard lobular well-defined swelling in the midshaft of humerus, which was not warm but tender. There was abnormal mobility present indicating a fracture. Plain radiograph of the affected arm showed an expansile, well-defined, intraosseous, radiolucent lesion with expansion involving the entire circumference of the humerus. An open biopsy was carried out and the report came out to be desmoplastic fibroma. She underwent wide segmental resection and interlocking nailing and bone grafting. After 6 weeks follow-up, the patient had visible callus and by 12 weeks there was significant union.",

It represents one of the rarest bone diseases, with an incidence of only 0.11% of all primary bone tumors.\nPATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, a case of massive and unusual DF, with simultaneous involvement of ilium and ischium, is described. A 29-year-old man suffered minor pain in his right hip for 2 years. It worsened after sudden movements, which prevented him from walking normally. Physical examination showed a limitation when the right hip was flexed and a percussion pain on the hip region. A medical imaging examination showed that the right ilium and ischium had a massive bone lesion. The top of acetabular had very little bone left and a fracture was likely at any time. No prominent body weight loss was noted, because there was no extensive invasion to the adjacent soft tissue.\nDIAGNOSES: DF of the Ilium and Ischium.\nINTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent a surgery involving curettage and grafting to maintain the stability of the pelvis.\nOUTCOMES: The definitive pathological diagnosis was DF, without evidence of malignancy. The postoperative recovery course at 3-month follow-up was uneventful.\nLESSONS: To the authors' knowledge, such a massive DF involving both ilium and ischium has been rarely reported. Young patients require appropriate and timely treatment modalities.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Reinventing data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs) to meet new analytical needs is slow and expensive. However, each new data research network that wishes to support its own analytics tends to develop its own data model. Joining these different networks without new data extraction, transform, and load (ETL) processes can reduce the time and expense needed to participate. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) project supports data network interoperability through an ontology-driven approach. We use i2b2 as a hub, to rapidly reconfigure data to meet new analytical requirements without new ETL programming.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Our 12-site National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) uses i2b2 to query data. We developed a process to generate a PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM) physical database directly from existing i2b2 systems, thereby supporting PCORnet analytic queries without new ETL programming. This involved: a formalized process for representing i2b2 information models (the specification of data types and formats); an information model that represents CDM Version 1.0; and a program that generates CDM tables, driven by this information model. This approach is generalizable to any logical information model.\nRESULTS: Eight PCORnet CDRN sites have implemented this approach and generated a CDM database without a new ETL process from the EHR. This enables federated querying within the CDRN and compatibility with the national PCORnet Distributed Research Network.\nDISCUSSION: We have established a way to adapt i2b2 to new information models without requiring changes to the underlying data. Eight Scalable Collaborative Infrastructure for a Learning Health System sites vetted this methodology, resulting in a network that, at present, supports research on 10 million patients' data.\nCONCLUSION: New analytical requirements can be quickly and cost-effectively supported by i2b2 without creating new data extraction processes from the EHR.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) has been implemented on various claims and electronic health record (EHR) databases, but has not been applied to a hospital transactional database. This study addresses the implementation of the OMOP CDM on the U.S. Premier Hospital database.\nMETHODS: We designed and implemented an extract, transform, load (ETL) process to convert the Premier hospital database into the OMOP CDM. Standard charge codes in Premier were mapped between the OMOP version 4.0 Vocabulary and standard charge descriptions. Visit logic was added to impute the visit dates. We tested the conversion by replicating a published study using the raw and transformed databases. The Premier hospital database was compared to a claims database, in regard to prevalence of disease.\nFINDINGS: The data transformed into the CDM resulted in 1% of the data being discarded due to data errors in the raw data. A total of 91.4% of Premier standard charge codes were mapped successfully to a standard vocabulary. The results of the replication study resulted in a similar distribution of patient characteristics. The comparison to the claims data yields notable similarities and differences amongst conditions represented in both databases.\nDISCUSSION: The transformation of the Premier database into the OMOP CDM version 4.0 adds value in conducting analyses due to successful mapping of the drugs and procedures. The addition of visit logic gives ordinality to drugs and procedures that wasn't present prior to the transformation. Comparing conditions in Premier against a claims database can provide an understanding about Premier's potential use in pharmacoepidemiology studies that are traditionally conducted via claims databases.\nCONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS: The conversion of the Premier database into the OMOP CDM 4.0 was completed successfully. The next steps include refinement of vocabularies and mappings and continual maintenance of the transformed CDM.",

Each model was evaluated against 11 criteria adapted from previous research. The criteria fell into six categories: content coverage, integrity, flexibility, ease of querying, standards compatibility, and ease and extent of implementation.\nResults\nThe OMOP CDM accommodated the highest percentage of our data elements (76%), fared well on other requirements, and had broader terminology coverage than the other models. Sentinel and PCORnet fell short in content coverage with 37% and 48% matches respectively. Although SDTM accommodated a significant percentage of data elements (55% true matches), 45% of the data elements mapped to SDTM’s extension mechanism, known as Supplemental Qualifiers, increasing the number of joins required to query the data.\nConclusion\nThe OMOP CDM best met the criteria for supporting data sharing from longitudinal EHR-based studies. Conclusions may differ for other uses and associated data element sets, but the methodology reported here is easily adaptable to common data model evaluation for other uses.",

		"abstract": "Background\nAdoption of a common data model across health systems is a key infrastructure requirement to allow large scale distributed comparative effectiveness analyses. There are a growing number of common data models (CDM), such as Mini-Sentinel, and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs.\n\nObjectives\nIn this case study, we describe the challenges and opportunities of a study specific use of the OMOP CDM by two health systems and describe three comparative effectiveness use cases developed from the CDM.\n\nMethods\nThe project transformed two health system databases (using crosswalks provided) into the OMOP CDM. Cohorts were developed from the transformed CDMs for three comparative effectiveness use case examples. Administrative/billing, demographic, order history, medication, and laboratory were included in the CDM transformation and cohort development rules.\n\nResults\nRecord counts per person month are presented for the eligible cohorts, highlighting differences between the civilian and federal datasets, e.g. the federal data set had more outpatient visits per person month (6.44 vs. 2.05 per person month). The count of medications per person month reflected the fact that one system’s medications were extracted from orders while the other system had pharmacy fills and medication administration records. The federal system also had a higher prevalence of the conditions in all three use cases. Both systems required manual coding of some types of data to convert to the CDM.\n\nConclusions\nThe data transformation to the CDM was time consuming and resources required were substantial, beyond requirements for collecting native source data. The need to manually code subsets of data limited the conversion. However, once the native data was converted to the CDM, both systems were then able to use the same queries to identify cohorts. Thus, the CDM minimized the effort to develop cohorts and analyze the results across the sites.",

One key to addressing usability problems is to employ user testing and user-centered design.\nOBJECTIVES: To understand if redesigning an EHR-based navigation tool with clinician input improved user performance and satisfaction.\nMETHODS: A usability evaluation was conducted to compare two versions of a redesigned ambulatory navigator. Participants completed tasks for five patient cases using the navigators, while employing a think-aloud protocol. The tasks were based on Meaningful Use (MU) requirements.\nRESULTS: The version of navigator did not affect perceived workload, and time to complete tasks was longer in the redesigned navigator. A relatively small portion of navigator content was used to complete the MU-related tasks, though navigation patterns were highly variable across participants for both navigators. Preferences for EHR navigation structures appeared to be individualized.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of EHR usability assessments to evaluate group and individual performance of different interfaces and preferences for each design.",

		"abstract": "Background:\nThe use of e-health can lead to several positive outcomes. However, the potential for e-health to improve healthcare is partially dependent on its ease of use. In order to determine the usability for any technology, rigorously developed and appropriate measures must be chosen.\n, \nObjectives:\nTo identify psychometrically tested questionnaires that measure usability of e-health tools, and to appraise their generalizability, attributes coverage, and quality.\n, \nMethods:\nWe conducted a systematic review of studies that measured usability of e-health tools using four databases (Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, and HAPI). Non-primary research, studies that did not report measures, studies with children or people with cognitive limitations, and studies about assistive devices or medical equipment were systematically excluded. Two authors independently extracted information including: questionnaire name, number of questions, scoring method, item generation, and psychometrics using a data extraction tool with pre-established categories and a quality appraisal scoring table.\n, \nResults:\nUsing a broad search strategy, 5,558 potentially relevant papers were identified. After removing duplicates and applying exclusion criteria, 35 articles remained that used 15 unique questionnaires. From the 15 questionnaires, only 5 were general enough to be used across studies. Usability attributes covered by the questionnaires were: learnability (15), efficiency (12), and satisfaction (11). Memorability (1) was the least covered attribute. Quality appraisal showed that face/content (14) and construct (7) validity were the most frequent types of validity assessed. All questionnaires reported reliability measurement. Some questionnaires scored low in the quality appraisal for the following reasons: limited validity testing (7), small sample size (3), no reporting of user centeredness (9) or feasibility estimates of time, effort, and expense (7).\n, \nConclusions:\nExisting questionnaires provide a foundation for research on e-health usability. However, future research is needed to broaden the coverage of the usability attributes and psychometric properties of the available questionnaires.\n, \nCitation:\nSousa VEC, Lopez KD.

		"abstract": "Real-time control of visual display systems via mid-air hand gestures offers many advantages over traditional interaction modalities. In medicine, for example, it allows a practitioner to adjust display values, e.g. contrast or zoom, on a medical visualization interface without the need to re-sterilize the interface. However, when users are holding a small tool (such as a pen, surgical needle, or computer stylus) the need to constantly put the tool down in order to make hand gesture interactions is not ideal. This work presents a novel interface that automatically adjusts for gesturing with hands and hand-held tools to precisely control medical displays. The novelty of our interface is that it uses a single set of gestures designed to be equally effective for fingers and hand-held tools without using markers. This type of interface was previously not feasible with low-resolution depth sensors such as Kinect, but is now achieved by using the recently released Leap Motion controller. Our interface is validated through a user study on a group of people given the task of adjusting parameters on a medical image.",

A 21-year-old female presented to The First Hospital of Jilin University (Changchun, Jilin, China) with thigh pain. Radiography demonstrated a lytic expansile lesion in the proximal femur. Curettage was performed, followed by use of an allogeneic graft. One month later, the patient suffered a pathological fracture and was treated with an open reduction and internal fixation. There was no recurrence of the tumor over a 28-year follow-up period. In conclusion, desmoplastic fibroma in the proximal femur is rare and an intralesional resection is strongly recommended to prevent recurrence. The disease may be misdiagnosed as a bone cyst, so the diagnosis should be confirmed with a histological examination.",

Periosteal lesions are very rare in the literature; diagnosis is usually based on the radiographic findings, and histological proof of the tumor origin is missing. A periosteal desmoplastic fibroma of the distal tibial metaphysis in a 3-year-old boy is presented. Radiographic investigation included plain radiographs and computed tomography imaging. Both demonstrated a soft tissue lesion involving the superficial bone tissues with non-aggressive looking borders and a pressure effect with a sclerotic rim in the bone. The lesion was excised, and the surgical as well as the histological findings indicated the diagnosis of a desmoplastic fibroma of bone arising from the periosteum. No recurrence was detected 5 years after surgery.",

One third of the lesions were diaphyseal in location, and 50% had associated cortical thickening, while 40% showed a stimulated periosteal reaction, and 20% contained sequestra. The variable radiological appearance was underscored by the fact that the preoperative diagnosis was other than osteomyelitis in half the cases. A diverse nomenclature has proliferated to describe and catalogue bone abscess formation. Although the radiological spectrum is broad, the unanimity of clinical presentation, pathological findings, and response to surgical excision supports the concept of a single entity with variable expression.",

The diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis is often challenging but can best be made by correlating radiography, bone scintigraphy and MRI with clinical information. Radiography should routinely be supplemented by sonography in the newborns and infants, if applicable. Brodie's abscess, which is clinically a subacute form of osteomyelitis, is best diagnosed by the combination of radiography and MRI. Chronic osteomyelitis is divided into primary haematogenous forms and exogenous, mostly post-traumatic, osteomyelitis. In the majority of patients, post-traumatic osteomyelitis is a clinical diagnosis; however, in a number of patients only the correlation of clinical findings, blood tests and imaging reveals the correct diagnosis. Often, MRI and scintigraphic methods, such as scanning with labeled leucocytes, together establish the diagnosis. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis may mimic bacterial osteomyelitis but is a distinct disease probably associated with the SAPHO syndrome.",

The patient had leg pain associated with prolonged use of her right leg, restlessness at night, and tenderness over the right tibia. The history did not suggest a mechanical cause of the patient's pain. All available radiographs were reviewed by the chiropractor; a diffuse lytic lesion with bone thickening and sclerosis was clearly visible in the area of the patient's chief complaint, representing a Brodie abscess.\nINTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The doctor of chiropractic sent the patient back to the hospital. She was treated first with oral antibiotics, which were not successful. She underwent surgery and recovered well.\nCONCLUSION: Subacute osteomyelitis may have a diagnostic delay; thus, it is possible for a chiropractor to see this condition in the office. A good case history, examination, and radiographs are important for the diagnosis and to make a proper referral.",

		"abstract": "Background:\nTuberculosis osteomyelitis is rarely seen in the diaphyseal bones. It may be confused with Brodie’s abscess due to similar clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Late diagnosis of the disease causes bone destruction. Tuberculosis osteomyelitis of the bone is a rare condition caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Its incidence has increased in Western countries in recent years due to HIV infection, increasing elderly population and emerging resistant strains. The slow progress of tuberculous osteomyelitis, due to lack of significant elevations in the laboratory values and changes in the radiographic appearance, often leads to confusion with the subtypes of subacute osteomyelitis, defined as Brodie’s abscess. These two low-virulence clinical cases often lead to delays in diagnosis and progressive bone destruction.\n\nCase presentation:\nWe report a 65-year-old male patient who presented to our clinic with pain, swelling and sensitivity in the left leg. Diagnosed with infection in the tibia, the patient had undergone antibiotherapy. However, the patient’s symptoms were not resolved and we performed bone curettage and cementation. M. tuberculosis-specific DNA was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and the M. tuberculosis complex was produced from the perioperative samples.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, histopathological examination and polymerase chain reaction are essential before surgery of subacute and chronic osteomyelitis with atypical clinical, laboratory and radiological findings for early diagnosis and accurate treatment.",

Dr. Campanacci brings to the readers the vast experience in musculoskeletal oncology of the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute in Bologna. As such, he has had at his disposal the patient records, radiographs and pathologic material dating back to 1905. The wealth of clinical material that has been accumulated at the Rizzoli Institute, with exquisite documentation and maintenance is a unique resource and testimonial to not only the author but his predecessors. This book brings to the reader an almost unparalleled experience from one of the leading centers of musculoskeletal oncology in the world. From the Foreword of William F. Enneking This second english edition is an entirely new book. It has been thoroughly rewritten, from the first to the last word. About 30% of the pictures are new. The new book incorporates the accumulated personal experience of the author, covering over 20.000 inpatients and many more outpatients, the perusal of the literature of the last 10 years, the recent developments in imaging (particularly MRI), microscopic diagnosis (especially immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy) and the ultimate progress in surgical and non-surgical treatment modalities. Mario Campanacci (1932-1999) was an orthopaedic surgeon and a pathologist with 40 years of experience (started in 1958 in the Laboratory of Pathology and Tumor Center of the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute) focused on musculoskeletal oncology. He was Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery and Pathology, University of Bologna, Director of the 1st Orthopaedic Clinic and of the Tumor Centre, Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute, Bologna and Director of the Graduate School of Orthopaedics, University of Bologna.",

Wide resection by total en bloc spondylectomy is difficult or not feasible for malignant vertebral tumors of the cervical spine due to the peculiar anatomic complexity of this region, including the vertebral arteries and the neural structures. There are no previous reports of en bloc resection of cervical spine tumors with wide surgical margins.\nMETHODS: Using staged posterior and anterior approaches, a total en bloc spondylectomy and spine arthrodesis was performed. En bloc excision of a C5 chordoma was achieved using a threadwire T-saw (Tomita and Kawahara, Kanazawa, Japan) with surgical margins free of tumor. The patient received postoperative adjuvant proton beam radiation therapy.\nRESULTS: The patient remains disease-free 9 years after the operation.\nCONCLUSION: Total en bloc spondylectomy with wide surgical margins is feasible for malignant bone tumors of the cervical spine.",

		"abstract": "Chordomas are locally invasive, malignant bone tumors that rarely occur in the cervical spine. En bloc resection or even fully resecting the tumor along its margin offers improved patient survival and a potential disease cure. Complete resection of tumors involving the upper cervical vertebrae requires a combined anterior-posterior approach but is complicated by the presence of vertebral arteries (VAs). In addition, reconstruction of the postresection defect may be prone to failure. The authors present a case of a chordoma involving the axis that was treated using a single-stage total intralesional C-2 spondylectomy with preservation of both VAs because the patient did not tolerate a preoperative occlusion test. A three-column reconstruction technique is also presented.",

		"abstract": "Chordoma is a rare low-grade malignant neoplasm derived from the remnants of the embryonic notochord. This locally invasive neoplasm is subject to recurrence after treatment. The median survival time is estimated to be 6.3 years. Various treatment approaches have been attempted, including radical excision, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Treatment outcome is significantly influenced by the size and site of the chordoma. Recently, Imatinib, a molecular-targeted agent, has been shown to have antitumor activity in chordoma. Proton radiotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy have also been used. Surgical treatment is still the primary choice for chordoma. It has become more aggressive in recent years, evolving from intralesional or partial excision to en bloc resection. However, upper cervical localizations make such en bloc resection in most cases not possible. We present and discuss the therapeutic challenges of a young female with large retropharyngeal chordoma who presented to our institution after conventional photon beam radiotherapy. This C2/3 tumor was classified IB according to the Enneking classification. It distributed to layers A–D and sectors 1–6 according to the Weinstein Boriani Biagini Classification. The left vertebral artery (VA) was encapsulated and displaced. One stage intralesional extracapsular tumor excision and reconstruction was achieved by combined bilateral high anterior cervical approaches and posterior approach. No recurrence or metastasis was observed 3 years after the operation. She returned to her previous occupation as office worker.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the radiographic features of clear cell chondrosarcoma (CCCS), including the computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) findings, and to correlate them with the histopathologic findings.\nDESIGN AND PATIENTS: A retrospective review was carried out of 72 patients with histopathologically confirmed CCCS. Imaging studies were available for 34 patients: conventional radiographs (n=28), CT scans (n=14), and MR images (n=15). Radiographic studies were reviewed by three radiologists who rendered a consensus opinion; the studies were correlated with the histopathologic findings.\nRESULTS: Of the 34 patients with imaging studies, 30 were male and 4 were female (mean age 38.6 years; range 11-74 years). Twenty-two lesions were in long bones (15, proximal femur; 1, distal femur; 1, proximal tibia; 5, proximal humerus) and 11 were in flat bones (5, vertebra; 4, rib; 1, scapula; 1, innominate). One lesion occurred in the tarsal navicular bone. Typically, long bone lesions were located in the epimetaphysis (19/22) and were lucent with a well-defined sclerotic margin and no cortical destruction or periosteal new bone formation. More than one-third of the long bone lesions contained matrix mineralization with a characteristic chondroid appearance. Pathologic fractures were present in six long bone lesions (4, humerus; 2, femur). Lesions in the proximal humerus were more likely to have indistinct margins (4/5) and extend into the diaphysis. Flat bone lesions were typically lytic and expansile and occasionally demonstrated areas of cortical disruption. Typically, matrix mineralization, when present, was amorphous. MR imaging, when available, was superior to conventional radiographs for demonstrating the intramedullary extent of a lesion as well as soft tissue extension. CT images better delineated the presence of cortical destruction and the character of matrix mineralization patterns. CCCS lesions were typically low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and moderately or significantly bright on T2-weighted images. Areas of lesion heterogeneity on T1- and T2-weighted images and on post-gadolinium T1-weighted images corresponded pathologically to areas of mineralization, intralesional hemorrhage, and cystic changes. Adjacent bone marrow edema was typically absent (12/15) or only minimally observed in a few cases (3/15). No cases examined with MR imaging demonstrated periosteal new bone formation.\nCONCLUSIONS: CCCS typically presents radiographically as a geographic lytic lesion located in the epimetaphyseal region of long bones. Most commonly lesions are found in the proximal femur, followed by the proximal humerus. Lesions within the proximal humerus may exhibit more aggressive features. Lesions in the axial skeleton are typically expansile and destructive, often with soft tissue extension and lack of mineralization. MR imaging may show the presence or absence of bone marrow edema.",

Eleven patients presented with a progressive painless swelling, 26% having had symptoms for over 10 years. The proximal phalanx was the commonest site. Initial clinical misdiagnosis as ganglion, bursa, gout, rheumatoid arthritis and a cyst occurred in five patients. Radiologically most lesions showed bone expansion, cortical destruction and soft-tissue extension. The majority was of high histologic grade (Evan's grade 2 & 3) with extensive myxoid areas. Five out of eight patients who were originally treated by curettage or excision had local recurrences compared to none treated by ray resection or amputation of phalanx (P=0.002). None had metastases. The low risk of metastases despite the high histologic grade indicates that chondrosarcomas of the hand behave differently from chondrosarcomas elsewhere.",

We present two patients with a sarcoma of the pelvis where for the first time a structured concept of technology integration led to a press-fit implantation of a hemipelvic prosthesis. This concept includes the design and production of a \"custom-made\" prosthesis as a hemipelvic substitute and the coating of this prosthesis with Bonit, a second-generation calcium phosphate, and gentamycin in watery solution. The tumor resection was done with computer-assisted surgery based on computed tomographies (CT) of the pelvis model done by rapid prototyping rather than on the CT of the patients' pelvis. With this procedure the presurgically simulated resection could be executed precisely with complete resection of the tumors and an accuracy which allowed an exact implantation of the prosthesis. The course was uneventful with primary healing and no sign of an infection or loosening after 6 months.",

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Osteochondromas are the most common benign tumour of the bone. They occur in two forms as solitary and hereditary multiple form. Osteochondromas are generally located on the metaphysis of the long bones. From 1 to 4% of osteochondromas occur in the spine. Spinal osteochondromas can cause cord and root compression and also be asymptomatic. In the diagnosis of osteochondromas, radiological methods are very important.\nPURPOSE OF STUDY: Because spinal osteochondroma is very rare, other benign and malign tumours should be kept in mind during differential diagnosis. In this paper, six patients with spinal osteochondral lesions were evaluated at our orthopaedic oncology department.\nPATIENTS: Between 1986 and 2009, six patients, four males, two females with an average age of 31.2 (9-65) were diagnosed with spinal osteochondroma at our clinic. Although one patient was diagnosed following another complaint, five patients were suffering from pain. In addition, four patients had swelling and one patient had neurological symptoms. Five patients were treated surgically, and the sixth one was followed conservatively.\nDISCUSSION: The patients with spinal osteochondral lesions applied with mostly pain and swelling at the dorsal of the vertebrae. Because neurological symptoms are rarely seen, radiological examination is of great importance in diagnosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering from spinal osteochondroma, due to the risk of secondary chondrosarcoma, must be closely evaluated both clinically and radiologically. If necessary, the patient must be treated surgically following histopathological diagnosis.",

Chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma are the most common sarcomas to originate from the pelvic bones. Various imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography play an important role in the detection, characterization, and staging of these lesions. Biopsy, usually performed with imaging guidance, is essential for the histologic diagnosis of these tumors and for planning therapeutic options. Despite considerable advances in treatment options, sarcomas in the pelvic bones generally are associated with poorer outcomes than sarcomas in the appendicular skeleton because of the larger size of the lesions at the time of discovery and the difficulty of obtaining a wide surgical resection margin. In this review, we discuss the various types of pelvic bone sarcomas and the role of imaging in patients with these lesions.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: This paper presents a single institution's longterm experience regarding the incidence and management of tumours of the atlas and axis and discusses clinical and imaging findings and treatment options.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the registry of the Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli for patients admitted and treated for tumours of the upper cervical spine. We identified 62 patients over 37 years, from July 1973 to October 2010. There were 39 male and 23 female patients, with a mean age of 39.5 (range 5-77) years. For each patient, we collected data on clinical presentation, imaging and treatment. Mean follow-up was 10 years.\nRESULTS: Benign bone tumours were diagnosed in 24 (39%) and malignant tumours in 38 (61%) patients. The most common tumours were bone metastases, followed by osteoid osteomas and chordomas. The atlas was involved in six and the axis in 52 patients; in four patients, both the atlas and axis were involved. The most common clinical presentation was pain, torticollis, dysphagia and neurological deficits. Surgical treatment was performed in 35 patients and conservative treatment, including intralesional methylprednisolone injections and halo-vest immobilisation with or without radiation therapy, chemotherapy or embolisation, in the remaining patients. One patient with osteoblastoma of the atlas had local recurrence. All patients with metastatic bone disease had local recurrence; four of the eight patients with plasmacytoma progressed to multiple myeloma within 1-4 years. All patients with chordomas had two to four local recurrences. Patients with osteosarcomas and chondrosarcoma died owing to local and distant disease progression.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bone tumours of the cervical spine are rare. However, they should be kept in mind when examining patients with neck pain or neurological symptoms at the extremities. In most cases, only intralesional surgery can be administered. Combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy is indicated for certain tumour histologies.",

		"abstract": "Among human neoplasms, primary malignant bone tumors are fairly rare. They present an incidence rate of roughly 10 cases per 1 million inhabitants per year. During childhood (<15 years), the percentage of malignant bone tumors amounts to 6% of all infantile malignancies. Only leukemia and lymphoma show a higher incidence in adolescence. Of all primary malignant bone tumors, 60% affect patients younger than 45 years and the peak incidence of all bone tumors occurs between 15 and 19 years. The most common primary malignant bone tumors are osteosarcoma (35%), chondrosarcoma (25%), and Ewing's sarcoma (16%). Less frequently (≤ 5%) occurring tumors are chordoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone, and fibrosarcoma of bone. Vascular primary malignant tumors of bone and adamantinoma are very rare. Staging of the lesion is essential for systemic therapeutic decision-making and includes complete imaging and histo-pathological confirmation of the suspected entity. In most cases, this is established by open- or image-guided biopsy. Based on this information, an interdisciplinary tumor board will determine the individual therapeutic approach. Endoprosthetic or biological reconstruction following wide tumor resection is the most common surgical therapy for primary malignant bone tumors. There is vital importance in a thorough postoperative follow-up and continous after-care by a competent tumor center which is permanentely in charge of therapy.",

Thirteen years after the initial excision, she re-presented with a large local recurrence requiring a hindquarter amputation. Local recurrence more than 10 years after the index operation is uncommon in pelvic chondrosarcoma.

We herein describe a first case of cervical DDCS in an 81-year-old male presenting with a slowly growing mass. Radiographs showed an expansion of the cortical contour of the C2 lamina and a soft tissue mass with punctate calcification. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a lobulated lesion expanding over the entire lamina and pedicles of C2 with the tumor protuberant to the adjacent soft tissue. A complete tumor resection was performed. Histologically, the majority of the tumor was a low-grade chondrosarcoma component. However, atypical spindle cells that had proliferated in a fascicular pattern with a collagenous stroma, mimicking fibrosarcoma, were focally observed without a transitional zone, and these features confirmed that the tumor was DDCS.",

		"abstract": "Background\nDistinguishing grade 1 chondrosarcoma from grade 2 chondrosarcoma is critical both for planning the surgical procedure and for predicting the outcome. We aimed to review the preoperative radiographic and histologic findings, and to evaluate the reliability of preoperative grading.\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 17 patients diagnosed with central chondrosarcoma at our institution between 1996 and 2011. In these cases, we compared the preoperative and postoperative histologic grades, and evaluated the reliability of the preoperative histologic grading. We also assessed the preoperative radiographic findings obtained using plain radiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nResults\nPreoperative histologic grade was 1 in 12 patients, 2 in 4 patients, and 3 in 1 patient. However, 6 of the 12 cases classified as grade 1 before surgery were re-classified as grade 2 postoperatively. In the radiographic evaluation, grade 1 was suspected by the presence of a ring-and-arc pattern of calcification on plain radiography and CT and entrapped fat and ring-and-arc enhancement on MRI. Grades 2 and 3 were suspected by the absence of calcification and the presence of cortical penetration and endosteal scalloping on plain radiography and CT, as well as soft-tissue mass formation on MRI.\n\nConclusion\nAlthough the combination of radiographic interpretation and histologic findings may improve the accuracy of preoperative grading in chondrosarcoma, the establishment of a standard evaluation system with the histologic and radiographic findings and/or the development of new biologic markers are necessary for preoperative discrimination of low-grade chondrosarcoma from high-grade chondrosarcoma.",

We reviewed the accuracy and safety of the radiological grading of cartilaginous tumours through the assessment of, first, pre-operative radiological and post-operative histological agreement, and second the rate of recurrence in lesions confirmed as high-grade on histology. We performed a retrospective review of major long bone cartilaginous tumours managed by curettage as low grade between 2001 and 2012. A total of 53 patients with a mean age of 47.6 years (8 to 71) were included. There were 23 men and 30 women. The tumours involved the femur (n = 20), humerus (n = 18), tibia (n = 9), fibula (n = 3), radius (n = 2) and ulna (n = 1). Pre-operative diagnoses resulted from multidisciplinary consensus following radiological review alone for 35 tumours, or with the addition of pre-operative image guided needle biopsy for 18. The histologically confirmed diagnosis was enchondroma for two (3.7%), low-grade chondrosarcoma for 49 (92.6%) and high-grade chondrosarcoma for two (3.7%). Three patients with a low-grade tumour developed a local recurrence at a mean of 15 months (12 to 17) post-operatively. A single high-grade recurrence (grade II) was treated with tibial diaphyseal replacement. The overall recurrence rate was 7.5% at a mean follow-up of 4.7 years (1.2 to 12.3). Cartilaginous tumours identified as low-grade on pre-operative imaging with or without additional image-guided needle biopsy can safely be managed as low-grade without pre-operative histological diagnosis. A few tumours may demonstrate high-grade features histologically, but the rates of recurrence are not affected.",

We aimed to analyze the outcome of pelvic ring reconstruction using a double-barreled free vascularized fibula graft (VFG) after internal hemipelvectomy with special reference to long-term complications.\n\nMaterials and methods\nWe conducted a retrospective review of 9 consecutive patients (5 male, 4 female; mean age 31 years) who underwent pelvic ring reconstruction using a double-barreled free VFG after internal hemipelvectomy (P1, n = 4; P1 + 4, n = 3; P1 + 2, n = 2) at our institution between 1998 and 2013. The mean follow-up period was 55 months (range 3–131 months).\n\nResults\nThe mean length of the bone defect was 9 cm. The methods of fixation included a Cotrel-Dubosset rod (n = 4), screw (n = 3), and screw and plate (n = 2). Bone union was achieved in 5 of 8 patients (63 %) over a 1-year follow-up. The mean period required for bone union was 5.4 months (range 3–7 months). There were 3 early postoperative complications: 2 deep infections resulting in graft removal and 1 implant failure resulting in non-union. Among 3 patients, 2 developed scoliosis within 5 years. One patient developed lumbar disc hernia as a result of scoliosis, for which surgical intervention was required. The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 57 % at the last follow-up.\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, this reconstruction method can achieve an early and high rate of bone union and provide good functional outcome. However, follow-up with careful attention to postoperative complications, including deep infection in the early postoperative period and spinal deformity in the long term, is necessary.",

Diagnosis is typically made through both radiographic and histologic means. In this case, the pathologic fracture was successfully treated with casting followed by intralesional curettage and bone-grafting. There was no evidence of recurrence at 18 months.",

		"abstract": "AIMS: Adjuvant treatment after intralesional curettage for atypical cartilaginous tumours (ACTs) of long bones is widely accepted for extending surgical margins. However, evaluating the isolated effect of adjuvant treatment is difficult, and it is unclear whether not using such adjuvants provides poor oncological outcomes. Hence, we analyzed whether intralesional curettage without cryosurgery or chemical adjuvants provides poor oncological outcomes in patients with an ACT.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 24 patients (nine men, 15 women) (mean age 45 years; 18 to 62) were treated for ACTs of long bones and followed up for a median of 66 months (interquartile range 50 to 84). All patients were treated with extensive manual curettage and limited burring. Bone cement and grafts were used to fill bone defects in 16 and eight patients, respectively. No chemical adjuvants or cryosurgery were used.\nRESULTS: No local recurrence was detectable on plain radiographs and MRI or CT images. At the last follow-up, there were no distant metastases or disease-specific deaths. No procedure-related complications or postoperative fractures developed.\nCONCLUSION: Intralesional curettage without cryosurgery or chemical adjuvants may provide excellent oncological outcomes for patients with ACTs of long bones, without the risk of complications related to adjuvant use. Our investigation suggests thorough curettage alone is a reasonable treatment option for ACT. However, we acknowledge the limited size of our investigation warrants a multicentre collaborative study to confirm our findings. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2018;100-B:256-61.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Primary malignant tumours of the hand are extremely rare, with chondrosarcoma being the most common. We describe six consecutive cases of chondrosarcoma (CS) of the hand, with a follow-up of 12 months to 10 years after surgical intervention.\nMETHODS: Five cases were primary tumors and one was secondary to Ollier's disease. Mean age at diagnosis was 67.5 years (range 46 to 85 years) and three patients were males. The bone most commonly affected was the proximal phalanx (in 4 patients), followed by the metacarpal bone (3 cases in the other 2 patients). The first symptom was an increase in volume in five cases and a pathological fracture in one. The x-ray study showed signs of malignancy in two cases only. In the other four cases, CT and MRI studies were necessary to complete the diagnosis.\nRESULTS: Primary amputation was performed in two cases and intralesional curettage and cancellous bone autograft in four. Primary amputation was performed in two cases and intralesional curettage and cancellous bone autograft in four. We found three grade I/III CS and three grade II/III CS in the histological study. Local recurrences occurred in three patients, two being grade II/III CS. One of the three had undergone an initial amputation and underwent re-amputation, another had had curettage of the lesion and was amputated, and the third patient decided not to undergo the procedure due to her age. A pulmonary nodule was suspected at the most recent follow up in a fourth patient, who had been diagnosed with a grade II/III CS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although CS of the hand bones behaves as a locally aggressive lesion, it rarely metastasizes. Intralesional curettage with a cancellous bone autograft appears to be a good option in low-grade CS to preserve the function, keeping in mind the high rate of recurrence. Wide excision or amputation is recommended when severe joint deformity or soft tissue involvement interferes with hand function.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features of para-acetabular chondrosarcoma (CS) and assess the difference between low-grade CS (LGCS) and high-grade CS (HGCS).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with histopathologically confirmed central para-acetabular CSs (6 LGCS and 25 HGCS) were retrospectively reviewed. Image features were evaluated for the following: cortical destruction, tumor border and pattern, calcification mode, soft-tissue mass, density/signal intensity, peritumoral edema, acetabular (cartilage) destruction, diffuse signal changes in acetabulum, mass inside hip joint, femoral head involvement, enhancement manifestations and the maximum length of the tumor. These image features between LGCS and HGCS were also assessed.\nRESULTS: The most common CT and/or MR findings included cortical destruction, punctate, ring-and-arc and linear calcification, soft-tissue mass, lobulated border, high signal intensity with low signal septa on T2-weighted image, peritumoral edema, hip joint infiltration, peripheral and septal enhancement on post-enhanced MR image. Statistical analysis showed that the image features, such as cortical destruction, soft-tissue mass, hip joint infiltration and tumor size were significantly different between LGCS and HGCS (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: The characteristic radiological features of para-acetabular CSs are osteolytic lesions with cortical destruction, soft-tissue mass, lobulated border, calcification, and high signal intensity with low signal septa on T2-weighted MR image, peripheral and septal enhancement on post-enhanced MR image. Cortical destruction, soft-tissue mass, hip joint infiltration and tumor size can differentiate HGCS from LGCS.",

There are many confusing issues concerning the imaging feature that can facilitate early diagnosis and the factors that might be related to outcomes.\n\nMethods\nTwenty-three patients with dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma confirmed by pathology were retrospectively reviewed from 2008 to 2015. The patients’ clinical information, images from radiographs (n = 17), CT (n = 19), and MRI (n = 17), histological features, treatment and prognosis were analyzed.\n\nResults\nThere were 12 males and 11 females, and the mean age was 50.39 years old. Fourteen cases affected the axial bone (pelvis, spine), and 9 cases involved the appendicular bone. Seven (41.17%), 9 (47.36), and 12 (66.66%) lesions showed a biphasic nature on radiograph, CT and MRI, respectively. Of the lesions, 17.39% (4/23) were accompanied by pathological fractures. Histologically, the cartilage component was considered histological Grade1 in 12 patients and Grade 2 in 11 patients. The dedifferentiated component showed features of osteosarcoma in 8 cases, malignant fibrous histiocytoma in3 cases, myofibroblastic sarcoma in 1 case and spindle cell sarcoma in 11cases. Twenty-two cases were treated with surgical resection, and 17 cases achieved adequate (wide or radical) surgical margin. In 8 cases, surgery was combined with adjuvant chemotherapy.

Imaging features are often specific. Recognizing periosteal chondrosarcoma and differentiating it from other surface tumors is of capital importance because the prognosis is excellent after adequate local surgery alone.",

Although it has a characteristic histological appearance, its radiological features and clinical presentation often mimic a benign lesion.

In addition, the tumour also had extensive areas of aneurysmal bone cyst-like changes, which is not only a rare histologic phenomenon in clear cell chondrosarcoma, but also a confounding factor in the interpretation of the radiologic findings.",

The demographics, clinical presentation, radiological features, treatment and follow-up are presented with the size, location, the histological grading of the tumour and the survival. We found a slight predominance of men (61%), and a predilection for the distal femur (33%) and proximal humerus (33%). The metaphysis was the most common site (47%) and the most common presentation was with pain (44%). Half the tumours were classified histologically as grade 1. Pulmonary metastases were reported in one patient after an intra-lesional resection. A second patient died from local recurrence and possible pulmonary and skin metastases after an incomplete resection. It is clearly important to make the diagnosis appropriately because an incomplete resection may result in local recurrence and metastatic spread. Staging for metastatic disease is recommended in grade II or III lesions. These patients should be managed with a contrast-enhanced MRI of the tumour and histological confirmation by biopsy, followed by en-bloc excision.",

		"abstract": "Chondromyxoid fibroma is a rare cartilage tumor that represents less than 1% of all bone tumors. When in a long bone, it is usually an intramedullary lesion that is eccentrically located in the metaphyseal region. Chondromyxoid fibroma may also have unusual presentations. These include intracortical lesions and subperiosteal lesions. There have been 14 reported cases of intracortical chondromyxoid fibroma, but there have been only four reports of subperiosteal lesions. A subperiosteal location, therefore, is extremely rare for a chondromyxoid fibroma. We present two new cases of subperiosteal chondromyxoid fibroma. Given its rarity, chondromyxoid fibroma is often not in the differential diagnosis of a painful, subperiosteal scalloped lesion in a long bone. Other entities such as periosteal chondroma, periosteal myxoma, subperiosteal ganglion cyst, or subperiosteal osteoid osteoma are more likely to be considered. Our cases illustrates that subperiosteal chondromyxoid fibroma, although rare, should be included in the differential diagnosis of a painful, radiographically inactive lytic lesion on the surface of a long bone.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF) is a rare neoplasm of the appendicular skeleton of young adults. We report 20 cases of a poorly recognized subtype which arises on the surface of long bones and erodes the cortical surface causing a periosteal reaction. This entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of bone surface lesions as it may be mistaken for a more aggressive neoplasm.\nDESIGN: A retrospective review at the Mayo Clinic identified 259 CMF cases, 13 of which were parosteal. Additionally, 2 cases were diagnosed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and 5 cases were from one of our authors' files. We reviewed the clinical radiographic and pathologic findings of all 20 cases.\nRESULTS: Juxtacortical CMF occurred over a large age range (12 to 82 y) with a median age of 40.2 years. A slight male predilection (5:4) was seen. The most common presentation was bone pain. All 20 cases showed solitary, radiolucent surface lesions with sclerotic margins and extension into the overlying soft tissues. Most of the lesions were in the proximal tibial metaphysis. Histologically, the tumors had characteristic features of CMF. Several cases contained distinctive areas of calcification, which is not a feature of conventional CMF. Eleven of 12 cases were cured with simple excision.\nCONCLUSION: CMF should be included in the differential diagnosis of bone surface lesions. The clinical and radiologic findings must be known. The morphology of this lesion is similar to conventional CMF with the exception of focal exuberant calcification. Conservative therapy is the treatment of choice.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF) and aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) are rare bone tumors and even rarer in the spine. To date, no report has been made of CMF with secondary ABC in the cervical spine.\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the diagnosis and surgical treatment of a case of CMF with secondary ABC of C6, a rare occurrence in an uncommon location.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The study design is a case report.\nMETHODS: A 27-year-old woman presented with numbness with paresthesias of the right upper extremity. Diagnostic imaging revealed diffuse enlargement of the right C6 lamina extending into the pedicle and medial facet joint. Surgical treatment consisted of complete C6 laminectomy, total resection of the extradural cervical mass, posterior lateral fusion at C5-C7, and posterior segmental instrumentation from C5 to C7. Histopathology was consistent with CMF with secondary ABC.\nRESULTS: Laminectomy and instrumented segmental fusion provided an excellent clinical outcome. The instrumented fusion maintained the sagittal balance of the spine and stabilized across a complete facetectomy. The excision will likely avoid recurrence of the lesion.\nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment of CMF and ABC is challenging in the spine because of the proximity to neural structures. Aggressive surgical treatment makes recurrence less likely but creates the risk of spinal instability. Adequate surgical treatment needs to provide spinal stability.",

		"abstract": "Informed consent is an ethical and legal requirement for research involving human participants. It is the process where a participant is informed about all aspects of the trial, which are important for the participant to make a decision and after studying all aspects of the trial the participant voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular clinical trial and significance of the research for advancement of medical knowledge and social welfare. The concept of informed consent is embedded in the principles of Nuremberg Code, The Declaration of Helsinki and The Belmont Report. Informed consent is an inevitable requirement prior to every research involving human being as subjects for study. Obtaining consent involves informing the subject about his or her rights, the purpose of the study, procedures to be undertaken, potential risks and benefits of participation, expected duration of study, extent of confidentiality of personal identification and demographic data, so that the participation of subjects in the study is entirely voluntary. This article provides an overview of issues in informed consent: The obligations of investigator, sponsor and Institutional Review Board to protect rights and welfare of human research subjects. It discusses about the basic elements of informed consent and the process to be followed while obtaining informed consent. Some of the circumstances under which informed consent can be waived and ethical challenges faced by physicians in obtaining informed consent from subjects are also highlighted in this article.",

		"abstract": "The effective coordination of health care relies on communication of confidential information about consumers between different health and community care services. However, consumers must be able to give or withhold \"e-Consent\" to those who wish to access their electronic health information. There are several possible forms for e-Consent. In the general consent model, a patient provides blanket consent for access to his or her information by an organization for all future information requests. Conversely, general denial explicitly denies consent for information to be used in future circumstances, and in each new episode of care, a new consent would be needed to obtain information. In the general consent with specific denial model, a patient attaches specific exclusion conditions to his or her general approval to future accesses. In contrast, in the general denial with explicit consent model, a patient issues a blanket block on all future accesses but allows the inclusion of future use under specified conditions. There also are several alternative functions for an e-Consent system. Consent could be captured as a matter of legal record. E-Consent systems could be more active by prompting clinicians to indicate that they have noted consent conditions before they access a record. Finally, the record of patient consent could be fully active and used as a gatekeeper in a distributed information environment. There probably will need to be some form of data object that is associated with patient information. This e-Consent object (or e-Co) will contain the specific conditions under which the data to which it is attached can be retrieved. Given the complexity of clinical work and the substantial variation we can expect in an individual's desire to make his or her personal medical details available, it is unlikely a \"one size fits all\" approach to e-Consent will work. Consequently, with a well-chosen consent design, it should be possible to balance the specific need for privacy of some of the population against the desire by others to err on the side of clinical safety, and clinicians desire to minimize the burden that an electronic consent mechanism would impose.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: One mechanism to increase participation in research is to solicit potential research participants' general willingness to be recruited into clinical trials. Such research permissions and consents typically are collected on paper upon patient registration. We describe a novel method of capturing this information electronically.\nPURPOSE: The objective is to enable the collection of research permissions and informed consent data electronically to permit tracking of potential research participants' interest in current and future research involvement and to provide a foundation for facilitating the research workflow.\nMETHODS: The project involved systematic analysis focused on key areas, including existing business practices, registration processes, and permission collection workflows, and ascertaining best practices for presenting consent information to users via tablet technology and capturing permissions data. Analysis was followed by an iterative software development cycle with feedback from subject matter experts and users.\nRESULTS: An initial version of the software was piloted at one institution in South Carolina for a period of 1 year, during which consents and permission were collected during 2524 registrations of patients. The captured research permission data were transmitted to a clinical data warehouse. The software was later released as an open-source package that can be adopted for use by other institutions.\nLIMITATIONS: There are significant ethical, legal, and informatics challenges that must be addressed at an institution to deploy such a system. We have not yet assessed the long-term impact of the system on recruitment of patients to clinical trials.\nCONCLUSIONS: We propose that by improving the ability to track willing potential research participants, we can improve recruitment into clinical trials and, in the process, improve patient education by introducing multimedia to informed consent documents.",

Außerdem zeigt sich bei den meisten Schmerzerkrankungen eine spezifische Wirksamkeit. Auch bei Patienten mit allergischen Erkrankungen ist Akupunktur wirksam. Akupunktur hat sich in den großen klinischen Studien als relativ sicheres Therapieverfahren erwiesen, allerdings kommen in seltenen Fällen auch schwere Komplikationen vor (z. B. Pneumothoraxfälle, Hepatitisinfektionen). In der Regel ist Akupunktur mit zusätzlichen Therapiekosten verbunden, gilt allerdings bei Schmerzerkrankungen als kosteneffektive Therapiestrategie.\n            \n            \n              Diskussion\n              Als nichtpharmakologischem Verfahren kommt Akupunktur eine wachsende Bedeutung bei der Behandlung von chronischen Schmerzerkrankungen und Allergien zu. Sie wird daher zunehmend in aktuelle Therapieleitlinien aufgenommen. In weiteren Studien sollte ihre Wirksamkeit bei weiteren Indikationen bestimmt werden. Die Wirkmechanismen sollten untersucht werden.\n            \n          , \n            Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy method that is also frequently used in the western world. It has been the subject of intensive scientific research over the past two decades.\n            \n            \n              Aim of the work\n              To describe the efficacy, therapy safety, and health economic relevance of acupuncture for chronic pain disorders and allergic diseases.\n            \n            \n              Material and methods\n              In the context of a review (narrative review) the relevant literature was selected, presented, and interpreted.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Acupuncture is effective in chronic pain disorders such as chronic knee joint pain in osteoarthritis, migraine, tension headache, chronic lumbar spine pain, chronic cervical spine pain, shoulder pain, dysmenorrhea, and fibromyalgia under routine conditions. In addition, specific efficacy is shown in most chronic pain indications. Acupuncture is also effective in patients with allergic diseases. In large clinical studies, acupuncture has proven to be a relatively safe therapy, but severe complications (e.g. pneumothorax cases, hepatitis B) also occur in rare instances. Acupuncture is usually associated with higher therapy costs, but is considered a cost-effective treatment strategy for pain disorders.\n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              As a nonpharmacological procedure, acupuncture is becoming increasingly important in pain and allergy therapy and is therefore increasingly included in current guidelines. In further studies, the efficacy of acupuncture should be determined in other indications and the mechanisms of action of this therapy method should be investigated.",

Random effects meta-analytical models through restricted maximum likelihood estimation were used to estimate pooled effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Outcomes included pain intensity (measured on a 0-100 point scale), disability (0-100 point scale), acceptability (discontinuation of the drug for any reason during treatment), and safety (adverse events, serious adverse events, and number of participants who withdrew from the trial because of an adverse event).\nResults 49 trials were included in the review, of which 31, sampling 6505 participants, were quantitatively analysed. For acute low back pain, very low certainty evidence showed that at two weeks or less non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were associated with a reduction in pain intensity compared with control (mean difference −7.7, 95% confidence interval−12.1 to−3.3) but not a reduction in disability (−3.3, −7.3 to 0.7). Low and very low certainty evidence showed that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might increase the risk of an adverse event (relative risk 1.6, 1.2 to 2.0) and might have little to no effect on acceptability (0.8, 0.6 to 1.1) compared with control for acute low back pain, respectively. The number of trials investigating other muscle relaxants and different durations of low back pain were small and the certainty of evidence was reduced because most trials were at high risk of bias.\nConclusions Considerable uncertainty exists about the clinical efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants. Very low and low certainty evidence shows that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might provide small but not clinically important reductions in pain intensity at or before two weeks and might increase the risk of an adverse event in acute low back pain, respectively. Large, high quality, placebo controlled trials are urgently needed to resolve uncertainty.\nSystematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42019126820 and Open Science Framework https://osf.io/mu2f5/.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 2008, over-the-counter cough and cold medications (CCMs) underwent labeling changes in response to safety concerns, including fatalities, reported in children exposed to CCMs. The objective of this study is to describe fatalities associated with exposures to CCMs in children <12 years old that were detected by a safety surveillance system from 2008 to 2016.\nMETHODS: Fatalities in children <12 years old that occurred between 2008 and 2016 associated with oral exposure to one or more CCMs were identified by the Pediatric Cough and Cold Safety Surveillance System. An expert panel reviewed all cases to determine the causal relationship between the exposure and death, if the intent of exposure was therapeutic, and if the dose was supratherapeutic. Other contributing factors related to the child’s death were also identified as part of a root cause analysis.\nRESULTS: Of the 180 eligible fatalities captured during the study period, 40 were judged by the expert panel to be either related or potentially related to the CCM. Of these, the majority (n 5 24; 60.0%) occurred in children <2 years old and involved nontherapeutic intent (n 5 22; 55.0%). The most frequently involved index ingredient was diphenhydramine (n 5 28; 70.0%). In 6 cases (n 5 6; 15.0%), the CCM was administered to murder the child. In another 7 cases (n 5 7; 17.5%), death followed the intentional use of the CCM to sedate the child.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pediatric fatalities associated with CCMs occurred primarily in young children after deliberate medication administration with nontherapeutic intent by a caregiver.",

This strain was compared with other vancomycin-resistant but nondependent E. faecalis strains by examining plasmid profiles and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of genomic DNA and by analyzing vancomycin-resistance genes identified by the polymerase chain reaction.\nRESULTS: An E. faecalis isolate, strain TJ310, was isolated repeatedly from the urine of a patient receiving long-term vancomycin therapy. This strain grew in primary culture but not on subculture, suggesting an unusual growth requirement, and ultimately was found to require the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin to grow. Strain TJ310 appeared to be closely related to other vancomycin-resistant but nondependent E. faecalis isolates with the vanB genotype previously isolated from the same patient, suggesting that vancomycin dependence may have evolved in vivo in a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strain during continuous exposure to high concentrations of vancomycin in the urine.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported example of a clinical bacterial isolate that requires an antimicrobial agent to grow.",

		"abstract": "Introduction:\nInsufficient patient enrollment in clinical trials remains a serious and costly problem and is often considered the most critical issue to solve for the clinical trials community., In this project, we assessed the feasibility of automatically detecting a patient’s eligibility for a sample of breast cancer clinical trials by mapping coded clinical trial eligibility criteria to the corresponding clinical information automatically extracted from text in the EHR.\n\nMethods:\nThree open breast cancer clinical trials were selected by oncologists. Their eligibility criteria were manually abstracted from trial descriptions using the OHDSI ATLAS web application. Patients enrolled or screened for these trials were selected as ‘positive’ or ‘possible’ cases. Other patients diagnosed with breast cancer were selected as ‘negative’ cases. A selection of the clinical data and all clinical notes of these 229 selected patients was extracted from the MUSC clinical data warehouse and stored in a database implementing the OMOP common data model. Eligibility criteria were extracted from clinical notes using either manually crafted pattern matching (regular expressions) or a new natural language processing (NLP) application. These extracted criteria were then compared with reference criteria from trial descriptions. This comparison was realized with three different versions of a new application: rule-based, cosine similarity-based, and machine learning-based.\n\nResults:\nFor eligibility criteria extraction from clinical notes, the machine learning-based NLP application allowed for the highest accuracy with a micro-averaged recall of 90.9% and precision of 89.7%. For trial eligibility determination, the highest accuracy was reached by the machine learning-based approach with a per-trial AUC between 75.5% and 89.8%.\n\nConclusion:\nNLP can be used to extract eligibility criteria from EHR clinical notes and automatically discover patients possibly eligible for a clinical trial with good accuracy, which could be leveraged to reduce the workload of humans screening patients for trials.",

		"abstract": "Background\nIntegrated data repositories (IDRs), also referred to as clinical data warehouses, are platforms used for the integration of several data sources through specialized analytical tools that facilitate data processing and analysis. IDRs offer several opportunities for clinical data reuse, and the number of institutions implementing an IDR has grown steadily in the past decade.\n\nObjective\nThe architectural choices of major IDRs are highly diverse and determining their differences can be overwhelming. This review aims to explore the underlying models and common features of IDRs, provide a high-level overview for those entering the field, and propose a set of guiding principles for small- to medium-sized health institutions embarking on IDR implementation.\n\nMethods\nWe reviewed manuscripts published in peer-reviewed scientific literature between 2008 and 2020, and selected those that specifically describe IDR architectures. Of 255 shortlisted articles, we found 34 articles describing 29 different architectures. The different IDRs were analyzed for common features and classified according to their data processing and integration solution choices.\n\nResults\nDespite common trends in the selection of standard terminologies and data models, the IDRs examined showed heterogeneity in the underlying architecture design. We identified 4 common architecture models that use different approaches for data processing and integration. These different approaches were driven by a variety of features such as data sources, whether the IDR was for a single institution or a collaborative project, the intended primary data user, and purpose (research-only or including clinical or operational decision making).\n\nConclusions\nIDR implementations are diverse and complex undertakings, which benefit from being preceded by an evaluation of requirements and definition of scope in the early planning stage. Factors such as data source diversity and intended users of the IDR influence data flow and synchronization, both of which are crucial factors in IDR architecture planning.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) causes 2.6 million visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) annually. These patients are often treated with skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs).\nOBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine whether efficacy of SMRs is associated with age, sex, or baseline LBP severity.\nMETHODS: This was a planned analysis of data from 4 randomized studies of patients with acute nonradicular LBP. Patients were enrolled during an ED visit and followed-up 1 week later. The primary outcome was improvement in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) between ED discharge and the 1-week follow-up. We compared the change in RMDQ among 8 groups: placebo, baclofen, metaxalone, tizanidine, diazepam, orphenadrine, methocarbamol, and cyclobenzaprine. All patients also received a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. We performed analysis of variance to determine statistically significant differences between medications and linear regression to determine the association of age, sex, and baseline severity with the primary outcome.\nRESULTS: The mean improvement in RMDQ per group was placebo 10.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.5-11.5), baclofen 10.6 (95% CI 8.6-12.7), metaxalone 10.3 (95% CI 8.1-12.4), tizanidine 11.5 (95% CI 9.5-13.4), diazepam 11.1 (95% CI 9-13.2), orphenadrine 9.5 (95% CI 7.4-11.5), methocarbamol 8.1 (95% CI 6.1-10.1), and cyclobenzaprine 10.1 (95% CI 8.3-12). The between-group differences were not statistically significantly different. Results were similar regardless of age, sex, and baseline severity. Higher baseline RMDQ was associated with greater clinical improvement (B coefficient 5.7, p < 0.01). Adverse medication effects were more common with cyclobenzaprine than with placebo (p < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients in the ED with acute LBP treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, SMRs do not improve outcomes more than placebo. Neither age, sex, nor baseline impairment impacts these results.",

		"abstract": "Background\nIntraosseous (IO) infusion of medication is a novel technique for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) antibiotic prophylaxis. To decrease postoperative pain in TKA patients, we investigated addition of morphine to a standard IO antibiotic injection.\nMethods\nA double-blind, randomized controlled trial was performed on 48 (24 each) consecutive patients undergoing primary TKA. The control group received an IO injection of antibiotics as per the standard protocol. The experimental group received an IO antibiotic injection with 10 mg of morphine. Pain, nausea, and opioid use were assessed up to 14 days postoperatively. Morphine and interleukin-6 serum levels were obtained 10 hours postoperatively in a subgroup of 20 patients.\nResults\nThe experimental group had lower Visual Analog Scale pain score at 1, 2, 3, and 5 hours postoperatively (P = .0032, P = .005, P = .020, P = .010). This trend continued for postoperative day 1, 2, 8, and 9 (40% reduction, P = .001; 49% reduction, P = .036; 38% reduction, P = .025; 33% reduction, P = .041). The experimental group had lower opioid consumption than the control group for the first 48 hours and second week postsurgery (P < .05). Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement scores for the experimental group showed significant improvement at 2 and 8 weeks postsurgery (P < .05). Serum morphine levels in the experimental group were significantly less than the control group 10 hours after IO injection (P = .049).\nConclusion\nIO morphine combined with a standard antibiotic solution demonstrates superior postoperative pain relief immediately and up to 2 weeks. IO morphine is a safe and effective method to lessen postoperative pain in TKA patients.\nLevel of Evidence\nTherapeutic, Level 1.",

		"abstract": "Introduction: Due to high volumes of data routinely recorded through Hospital Information System, data reuse has become important in recent years. A data warehouse was developed in the Lille University Hospital to reuse anesthesia data. At the moment, it is mainly used for clinical research, by offering extraction of data tables to answer a clinical question. In this article, we try to identify other contexts of data reuse than the one currently provided by the data warehouse, in comparison with those in the literature. Material and methods: A semi-structured interview grid was designed so that to tackle respondents’ experience with clinical data reuse, the various contexts in which the data are reused along with the information systems they currently use to proceed and the difficulties they encounter. A semi-inductive thematic analysis process was performed to identify meaningful semantic units and grouped them into thematic categories. Results: Ten anesthetists were interviewed; three main contexts emerge: research and knowledge discovery, evaluation of professional practices and organizational management. Data are accessed through complicated administrative procedures and clinicians have to perform tasks beyond their competencies. Discussion: Difficulties encountered when searching for data express the need for easy and continuous access to data.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Real-world evidence (RWE) is essential for the development of pharmaceutical and medical technologies and informs treatment-related decisions by regulatory agencies, payers, healthcare providers, and patients. Given that planning RWE studies present diverse challenges, we developed the RWE Framework, a concise, visual, interactive tool designed to align multidisciplinary stakeholders toward common goals and encourage a methodical approach to RWE study planning.\nMETHODS: A search of published literature and internet-based resources was performed to identify guidance on RWE study planning with decision and/or visual aids. A conceptual framework for a study design tool was developed based on best practices for RWE studies, enhanced with an infographic design, and refined by multidisciplinary input from RWE researchers.\nRESULTS: The searches confirmed an unmet need for a concise tool to support a broad range of RWE study designs: only two sources with decision/visual aids were identified. The novel RWE Framework comprises sequential decision steps with instructions to guide users through consideration of research objectives, product approval status, study setting, outcomes of interest, data availability in routine practice, need for primary data collection and/or randomization, study type and methodology, and applicable regulatory standards. Pilot testing using case studies of pharmaceutical assets demonstrated the utility of RWE Framework and applicability for use in team environments.\nCONCLUSIONS: The RWE Framework is a novel, concise, visual, and interactive tool to inform RWE study planning. It addresses a broad range of real-world study types and research objectives and was found to enhance RWE decision-making by multidisciplinary teams. Further validation is warranted.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            Background The interest in information extraction from clinical reports for secondary data use is increasing. But experience with the productive use of information extraction processes over time is scarce. A clinical data warehouse has been in use at our university hospital for several years, which also provides an information extraction of echocardiography reports developed for general use.\n            Objectives This study aims to illustrate the difficulties encountered, while using data from a preexisting information extraction process for a large clinical study. To compare the data from the preexisting process with the data obtained from a specially developed process designed to improve the quality and completeness of the study data.\n            Methods We extracted the echocardiography variables for 440 patients from the general-use information extraction of the data warehouse (678 reports). Then we developed an information extraction process for the same variables but specifically for this study, with the aim to extract as much information as possible from the text. The extracted data of both processes were compared with a newly created gold standard defined by a cardiologist with long-standing experience in heart failure.\n            Results Among 57 echocardiography variables considered relevant for the study, 50 were documented in the routine text reports and could be extracted. Twenty of the required variables were not provided by the general-use extraction process, some others were not provided correctly. The median macro F1-score (precision, recall) across the 30 variables for which values were extracted was 0.81 (0.94, 0.77). Across all 50 variables, as relevant for the study, median macro F1-score was only 0.49 (0.56, 0.46). Employing the study-specific approach considerably improved the quality and completeness of the variables, resulting in F1-scores of 0.97 (0.98, 0.96) across all variables.\n            Conclusion Data from information extractions can be used for large clinical studies. However, preexisting information extraction processes should be treated with caution, as the time and effort spent defining each variable in the information extraction process may not be clear.",

		"abstract": "Iron deficiency is a major heart failure co-morbidity present in about 50% of patients with stable heart failure irrespective of the left ventricular function. Along with compromise of daily activities, it also increases patient morbidity and mortality, which is independent of anaemia. Several trials have established parenteral iron supplementation as an important complimentary therapy to improve patient well-being and physical performance. Intravenous iron preparations, in the first-line ferric carboxymaltose, demonstrated in previous clinical trials superior clinical effect in comparison with oral iron preparations, improving New York Heart Association functional class, 6 min walk test distance, peak oxygen consumption, and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure. Beneficial effect of iron deficiency treatment on morbidity and mortality of heart failure patients is waiting for conformation in ongoing trials. Although the current guidelines for treatment of chronic and acute heart failure acknowledge importance of iron deficiency correction and recommend intravenous iron supplementation for its treatment, iron deficiency remains frequently undertreated and insufficiently diagnosed in setting of the chronic heart failure. This paper highlights the current state of the art in the pathophysiology of iron deficiency, associations with heart failure trajectory and outcome, and an overview of current guideline-suggested treatment options.",

Prescribing patterns and HRU were characterized by treatment line and summarized by descriptive statistics. Proxy progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. <b><i>Results:</i></b> 536 patients receiving mRCC treatment were included. The median treatment duration was 4.2 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.7–9.3) for first-line therapy and 3.8 months (IQR: 1.7–9.1) for second-line therapy. Median PFS and OS estimates were similar for the first- and second-line treatments: PFS, 7.4 versus 7.2 months; OS, 14.9 versus 13.6 months. Mean HRU costs were higher for patients receiving first-line therapy (€7,253.2) compared with those receiving second-line therapy (€6,242.9). Exploratory stratification of outcomes by centre expertise suggested a possible trend towards improved OS in the 10 most experienced centres versus all -others: first-line, 18.4 versus 13.2 months; second-line, 16.4 versus 12.4 months. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> In routine care, German clinicians make rational prescribing decisions; possible variations in outcomes between centres warrant further investigation.",

		"abstract": "AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the burden of heart failure (HF) patients with/without iron deficiency/iron deficiency anaemia (ID/A) from the health insurance perspective.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a retrospective claims database analysis using the Institut für angewandte Gesundheitsforschung Berlin research database. The study period spanned from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014. HF patients were identified by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, German Modification codes (I50.-, I50.0-, I50.00, I50.01, I50.1-, I50.11, I50.12, I50.13, I50.14, I50.19, and I50.9). HF patients were stratified into HF patients without ID/A and HF patients with ID/A (D50.-, D50.0, D50.8, D50.9, and E61.1). HF patients with ID/A were stratified into three subgroups: no iron treatment, oral iron treatment, and intravenous iron treatment. A matching approach was applied to compare outcomes for HF patients without ID/A vs. HF patient with untreated incident ID/A without iron treatment and for HF patients receiving no iron treatment vs. oral iron treatment vs. intravenous iron treatment. Matching parameters included exact age, sex, and New York Heart Association functional class. An optimization algorithm was used to balance total health care costs in the baseline period for the potential matched pairs without sample size reduction. In total, 172 394 (4537.4 per 100 000) HF patients were identified in the Institut für angewandte Gesundheitsforschung Berlin research database in 2013. Of these, 11.1% (19 070; 501.9 per 100 000) were diagnosed with ID/A and/or had a prescription for iron medication in 2013. The mean age of HF patients was 77.0 years (±12.0 years). Women were more frequently diagnosed with HF (54.6%). HF patients with untreated incident ID/A (1.77%) had a significantly higher all-cause mortality than HF patients without ID/A (33.1% vs. 24.1%, P < 0.01). The analysis of health care utilization revealed significant differences in the rate of all-cause hospitalization (72.9% vs. 50.5%, P < 0.01). The annual health care costs for HF patients with untreated incident ID/A amounted to €17 347 with incremental costs of €849 (P < 0.01) attributed to ID/A.\nCONCLUSIONS: Heart failure is associated with a major burden for patients and the health care system in terms of health care resource utilization, costs, and mortality. Our findings suggest that there is an unmet need for treating more HF patients with ID/A with iron medication.",

We leveraged Shiny with R to develop interactive interfaces on FHIR-based data and used ovarian cancer study datasets as a use case to implement a prototype. Specifically, we implemented patient index, patient-centered data report and analysis, and cohort analysis. The evaluation of our study was performed by testing the adaptability of the framework on two public FHIR servers. We identify common research requirements and current outstanding issues, and discuss future enhancement work of the current studies.

		"abstract": "MOTIVATION: Knowledge Graph (KG) is becoming increasingly important in the biomedical field. Deriving new and reliable knowledge from existing knowledge by knowledge graph embedding technology is a cutting-edge method. Some add a variety of additional information to aid reasoning, namely multimodal reasoning. However, few works based on the existing biomedical KGs are focused on specific diseases.\nRESULTS: This work develops a construction and multimodal reasoning process of Specific Disease Knowledge Graphs (SDKGs). We construct SDKG-11, a SDKG set including five cancers, six non-cancer diseases, a combined Cancer5, and a combined Diseases11, aiming to discover new reliable knowledge and provide universal pre-trained knowledge for that specific disease field. SDKG-11 is obtained through original triplet extraction, standard entity set construction, entity linking, and relation linking. We implement multimodal reasoning by reverse-hyperplane projection for SDKGs based on structure, category, and description embeddings. Multimodal reasoning improves pre-existing models on all SDKGs using entity prediction task as the evaluation protocol. We verify the model's reliability in discovering new knowledge by manually proofreading predicted drug-gene, gene-disease, and disease-drug pairs. Using embedding results as initialization parameters for the biomolecular interaction classification, we demonstrate the universality of embedding models.\nAVAILABILITY: The constructed SDKG-11 and the implementation by TensorFlow are available from https://github.com/ZhuChaoY/SDKG-11.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment in surgical patients is important for the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of patients. The commonly used Caprini model is limited by its inadequate ability to discriminate between risk stratums on the surgical population in southwest China and lengthy risk factors. The purpose of this study was to establish an improved VTE risk assessment model that is accurate and simple.\nMETHODS: This study is based on the clinical data from 81,505 surgical patients hospitalized in the Southwest Hospital of China between January 1, 2019 and June 18, 2021. Among the population, 559 patients developed VTE. An improved VTE risk assessment model, SW-model, was established through Logistic Regression, with comparisons to both Caprini and Random Forest.\nRESULTS: The SW-model incorporated eight risk factors. The area under the curve (AUC) of SW-model (0.807 [0.758, 0.853], 0.804 [0.765, 0.840]), are significantly superior (p = 0.001 and p = 0.044) to those of the Caprini (0.705 [0.652, 0.757], 0.758 [0.719, 0795]) on two test sets, but inferior (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002) to Random Forest (0.854 [0.814, 0.890], 0.839 [0.806, 0.868]). In decision curve analysis, within threshold range from 0.015 to 0.04, the DCA curves of the SW-model are superior to Caprini and two default strategies.\nCONCLUSIONS: The SW-model demonstrated a higher discriminative capability to distinguish VTE positive in surgical patients compared with the Caprini model. Compared to Random Forest, Logistic Regression based SW-model provided interpretability which is essential in guarantee the procedure of risk assessment transparent to clinicians.",

		"abstract": "Background: The use of web-based monitoring for lung cancer patients is growing in interest because of promising recent results suggesting improvement in cancer and resource utilization outcomes. It remains an open question whether the overall survival (OS) in these patients could be improved by using a web-mediated follow-up rather than classical scheduled followup and imaging.\nMethods: Advanced-stage lung cancer patients without evidence of disease progression after or during initial treatment were randomly assigned in a multicenter phase III trial to compare a web-mediated follow-up algorithm (experimental arm), based on weekly self-scored patient symptoms, with routine follow-up with CT scans scheduled every three to six months according to the disease stage (control arm). In the experimental arm, an alert email was automatically sent to the oncologist when self-scored symptoms matched predeﬁned criteria. The primary outcome was OS.\nResults: From June 2014 to January 2016, 133 patients were enrolled and 121 were retained in the intent-to-treat analysis; 12 deemed ineligible after random assignment were not subsequently followed. Most of the patients (95.1%) had stage III or IV disease. The median follow-up was nine months. The median OS was 19.0 months (95% conﬁdence interval [CI] ¼ 12.5 to noncalculable) in the experimental and 12.0 months (95% CI ¼ 8.6 to 16.4) in the control arm (one-sided P ¼ .001) (hazard ratio ¼ 0.32, 95% CI ¼ 0.15 to 0.67, one-sided P ¼ .002). The performance status at ﬁrst detected relapse was 0 to 1 for 75.9% of the patients in the experimental arm and for 32.5% of those in the control arm (two-sided P < .001). Optimal treatment was initiated in 72.4% of the patients in the experimental arm and in 32.5% of those in the control arm (two-sided P < .001).\nConclusions: A web-mediated follow-up algorithm based on self-reported symptoms improved OS due to early relapse detection and better performance status at relapse.",

The past 4 years have seen the development of EP PASSION: a multi-stakeholder, collaborative effort between the FDA, CIED manufacturers, Heart Rhythm Society, and academics. Using real-world data, EP PASSION enables longitudinal evaluation of the long-term safety of CIED leads, addressing limitations of current approaches to generate evidence that informs regulatory, clinical, and manufacturer decisionmaking. This state of the art article describes the impetus for and launch of EP PASSION, the lessons learned, its current state, the current analytic approach, and the strengths and limitations of leveraging extant data sources for post-market lead evaluation. We also compare EP PASSION to traditional post-approval studies and describe possible future directions.",

This work introduces a data quality framework for observational health research data collections with supporting software implementations to facilitate harmonized data quality assessments.\n\nMethods\nDevelopments were guided by the evaluation of an existing data quality framework and literature reviews. Functions for the computation of data quality indicators were written in R. The concept and implementations are illustrated based on data from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP).\n\nResults\nThe data quality framework comprises 34 data quality indicators. These target four aspects of data quality: compliance with pre-specified structural and technical requirements (integrity); presence of data values (completeness); inadmissible or uncertain data values and contradictions (consistency); unexpected distributions and associations (accuracy). R functions calculate data quality metrics based on the provided study data and metadata and R Markdown reports are generated. Guidance on the concept and tools is available through a dedicated website.\n\nConclusions\nThe presented data quality framework is the first of its kind for observational health research data collections that links a formal concept to implementations in R. The framework and tools facilitate harmonized data quality assessments in pursue of transparent and reproducible research. Application scenarios comprise data quality monitoring while a study is carried out as well as performing an initial data analysis before starting substantive scientific analyses but the developments are also of relevance beyond research.",

		"abstract": "Background\nData quality assessment is important but complex and task dependent. Identifying suitable measurement methods and reference ranges for assessing their results is challenging. Manually inspecting the measurement results and current data driven approaches for learning which results indicate data quality issues have considerable limitations, e.g. to identify task dependent thresholds for measurement results that indicate data quality issues.\n\nObjectives\nTo explore the applicability and potential benefits of a data driven approach to learn task dependent knowledge about suitable measurement methods and assessment of their results. Such knowledge could be useful for others to determine whether a local data stock is suitable for a given task.\n\nMethods\nWe started by creating artificial data with previously defined data quality issues and applied a set of generic measurement methods on this data (e.g. a method to count the number of values in a certain variable or the mean value of the values). We trained decision trees on exported measurement methods’ results and corresponding outcome data (data that indicated the data’s suitability for a use case). For evaluation, we derived rules for potential measurement methods and reference values from the decision trees and compared these regarding their coverage of the true data quality issues artificially created in the dataset. Three researchers independently derived these rules. One with knowledge about present data quality issues and two without.\n\nResults\nOur self-trained decision trees were able to indicate rules for 12 of 19 previously defined data quality issues. Learned knowledge about measurement methods and their assessment was complementary to manual interpretation of measurement methods’ results.\n\nConclusions\nOur data driven approach derives sensible knowledge for task dependent data quality assessment and complements other current approaches. Based on labeled measurement methods’ results as training data, our approach successfully suggested applicable rules for checking data quality characteristics that determine whether a dataset is suitable for a given task.\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12911-021-01656-x.",

		"abstract": "Background\n Many research initiatives aim at using data from electronic health records (EHRs) in observational studies. Participating sites of the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) established data integration centers to integrate EHR data within research data repositories to support local and federated analyses. To address concerns regarding possible data quality (DQ) issues of hospital routine data compared with data specifically collected for scientific purposes, we have previously presented a data quality assessment (DQA) tool providing a standardized approach to assess DQ of the research data repositories at the MIRACUM consortium's partner sites.\n, Objectives\n Major limitations of the former approach included manual interpretation of the results and hard coding of analyses, making their expansion to new data elements and databases time-consuming and error prone. We here present an enhanced version of the DQA tool by linking it to common data element definitions stored in a metadata repository (MDR), adopting the harmonized DQA framework from Kahn et al and its application within the MIRACUM consortium.\n, Methods\n Data quality checks were consequently aligned to a harmonized DQA terminology. Database-specific information were systematically identified and represented in an MDR. Furthermore, a structured representation of logical relations between data elements was developed to model plausibility-statements in the MDR.\n, Results\n The MIRACUM DQA tool was linked to data element definitions stored in a consortium-wide MDR. Additional databases used within MIRACUM were linked to the DQ checks by extending the respective data elements in the MDR with the required information. The evaluation of DQ checks was automated. An adaptable software implementation is provided with the R package\nDQAstats\n.\n, Conclusion\n The enhancements of the DQA tool facilitate the future integration of new data elements and make the tool scalable to other databases and data models. It has been provided to all ten MIRACUM partners and was successfully deployed and integrated into their respective data integration center infrastructure.",

		"abstract": "AIM: Peripheral nerve tumors (PNT) are rare lesions. To date, no systematic multicenter studies on epidemiology, clinical symptoms, treatment strategies and outcomes, genetic and histopathologic features, as well as imaging characteristics of PNT were published. The main goal of our PNT Registry is the systematic multicenter investigation to improve our understanding of PNT and to assist future interventional studies in establishing hypotheses, determining potential endpoints, and assessing treatment efficacy.\nMETHODS: Aims of the PNT registry were set at the 2015 Meeting of the Section of Peripheral Nerve Surgery of the German Society of Neurosurgery. A study protocol was developed by specialists in PNT care. A minimal data set on clinical status, treatment types and outcomes is reported by each participating center at initial contact with the patient and after 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years. Since the study is coordinated by the Charité Berlin, the PNR Registry was approved by the Charité ethics committee (EA4/058/17) and registered with the German Trials Registry (www.drks.de). On a national level, patient inclusion began in June 2016. The registry was rolled out across Europe at the 2019 meeting of the European Association of Neurosurgery in Dublin.\nRESULTS: Patient recruitment has been initiated at 10 centers throughout Europe and 14 additional centers are currently applying for local ethics approval.\nCONCLUSION: To date, the PNT registry has grown into an international study group with regular scientific and clinical exchange awaiting the first results of the retrospective study arm.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: CyberKnife© Radiosurgery (CKRS) is a recognized treatment concept for CNS lesions in adults due to its high precision and efficacy beside a high patient comfort. However, scientific evidence for this treatment modality in pediatric patients is scarce. A dedicated registry was designed to document CyberKnife© procedures in children, aiming to test the hypothesis that it is safe and efficient for the treatment of CNS lesions.\nMETHODS: The CyberKnife© registry is designed as a retrospective and prospective multicenter observational study (German Clinical Trials Register ( https://www.drks.de ), DRKS-ID 00016973). Patient recruitment will be ongoing throughout a 5-year period and includes collection of demographic, treatment, clinical, and imaging data. Follow-up results will be monitored for 10 years. All data will be registered in a centralized electronic database at the Charité-Universitätsmedizin. The primary endpoint is stable disease for benign and vascular lesions at 5 years of follow-up and local tumor control for malign lesions at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Secondary endpoints are radiation toxicity, side effects, and neurocognitive development.\nCONCLUSION: The CyberKnife© registry intends to generate scientific evidence for all treatment- and outcome-related aspects in pediatric patients with treated CNS lesions. The registry may define safety and efficacy of CKRS in children and serve as a basis for future clinical trials, inter-methodological comparisons and changes of treatment algorithms.",

		"abstract": "AIMS AND HYPOTHESIS: Giant intracranial aneurysms have a poor prognosis mainly due to their high risk of rupture. Because their incidence is low, clinical trial evidence for adequate treatment is lacking. The Giant Intracranial Aneurysm Registry is designed to document current treatment strategies in giant aneurysm care and to monitor the course of the disease over five-years. It aims to evaluate the hypothesis that all three possible branches of therapy (conservative/endovascular/surgical) lead to equal rupture rates.\nDESIGN: The Giant Intracranial Aneurysm Registry is an interdisciplinary multicenter observational study. Each center recruits patients diagnosed with a giant intracranial aneurysm both prospectively and retrospectively. Primary outcome will be the aneurysm rupture rate at five-years of follow-up.\nSTUDY OUTCOME: Patient enrollment has begun at 20 neurovascular centers throughout Germany, with 19 further centers applying for local ethics approval to take part in the study. The first nine months are designed as a pilot phase followed by the integration of study centers throughout the EU and the initiation of separate sub-studies.\nDISCUSSION: Giant intracranial aneurysms have often been ignored or marginalized due to their low incidence. The Giant Intracranial Aneurysm Registry aims to lead to a better understanding of these complex lesions and to serve as a basis for the development of future clinical studies.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health care data are increasing in volume and complexity. Storing and analyzing these data to implement precision medicine initiatives and data-driven research has exceeded the capabilities of traditional computer systems. Modern big data platforms must be adapted to the specific demands of health care and designed for scalability and growth.\nOBJECTIVE: The objectives of our study were to (1) demonstrate the implementation of a data science platform built on open source technology within a large, academic health care system and (2) describe 2 computational health care applications built on such a platform.\nMETHODS: We deployed a data science platform based on several open source technologies to support real-time, big data workloads. We developed data-acquisition workflows for Apache Storm and NiFi in Java and Python to capture patient monitoring and laboratory data for downstream analytics.\nRESULTS: Emerging data management approaches, along with open source technologies such as Hadoop, can be used to create integrated data lakes to store large, real-time datasets. This infrastructure also provides a robust analytics platform where health care and biomedical research data can be analyzed in near real time for precision medicine and computational health care use cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: The implementation and use of integrated data science platforms offer organizations the opportunity to combine traditional datasets, including data from the electronic health record, with emerging big data sources, such as continuous patient monitoring and real-time laboratory results. These platforms can enable cost-effective and scalable analytics for the information that will be key to the delivery of precision medicine initiatives. Organizations that can take advantage of the technical advances found in data science platforms will have the opportunity to provide comprehensive access to health care data for computational health care and precision medicine research.",

		"abstract": "Although firms’ announcement of data breaches can lead to reputational or operational damages, extant research suggests that stock markets are relatively unresponsive to such announcements. We investigate whether markets’ unresponsiveness can be explained by firms strategically timing the announcement to coincide with busy days in the media, thereby reducing attention and, ultimately, attenuating market reactions. We leverage novel data on data breach announcements in the United States between 2008 and 2018 and create a measure of busyness in the trade press—news pressure—based on the Wall Street Journal. To investigate, we conduct two complementary studies. In Study 1, we employ an instrumental variable approach to assess whether announcements coincide with days of predictably high news pressure. We find that this is the case. On days with a one-standard-deviation-higher predictable news pressure, 4.44% more data breaches are announced (or approximately 19.024 data records). Strategic timing is more prevalent for breaches that are severe, that have firm-internal causes, and that leak healthcare data or credentials. In Study 2, we utilize a stock market event study to assess market reactions conditional on news pressure on the announcement day. We find that data breach announcements are associated with negative market reactions, yet these are attenuated by higher news pressure on the announcement day. If news pressure is on its empirical mean (respectively, one standard deviation above), we estimate a median decline in market capitalization of $347 (respectively, $85) million. We conclude that firms’ strategic timing might explain inconsistent findings in prior work.This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems.",

		"abstract": "<p> <b>Background</b> Hospital readmissions are a key quality metric, which has been tied to reimbursement. One strategy to reduce readmissions is to direct resources to patients at the highest risk of readmission. This strategy necessitates a robust predictive model coupled with effective, patient-centered interventions.</p> <p> <b>Objective</b> The aim of this study was to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions through the use of artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support.</p> <p> <b>Methods</b> A commercially vended artificial intelligence tool was implemented at a regional hospital in La Crosse, Wisconsin between November 2018 and April 2019. The tool assessed all patients admitted to general care units for risk of readmission and generated recommendations for interventions intended to decrease readmission risk. Similar hospitals were used as controls. Change in readmission rate was assessed by comparing the 6-month intervention period to the same months of the previous calendar year in exposure and control hospitals.</p> <p> <b>Results</b> Among 2,460 hospitalizations assessed using the tool, 611 were designated by the tool as high risk. Sensitivity and specificity for risk assignment were 65% and 89%, respectively. Over 6 months following implementation, readmission rates decreased from 11.4% during the comparison period to 8.1% (<i>p</i> < 0.001). After accounting for the 0.5% decrease in readmission rates (from 9.3 to 8.8%) at control hospitals, the relative reduction in readmission rate was 25% (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Among patients designated as high risk, the number needed to treat to avoid one readmission was 11.</p> <p> <b>Conclusion</b> We observed a decrease in hospital readmission after implementing artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support. Our experience suggests that use of artificial intelligence to identify patients at the highest risk for readmission can reduce quality gaps when coupled with patient-centered interventions.</p>",

However, limitations in EHR functionality remain, leading practitioners to use workarounds while managing test results. Workarounds can lead to patient safety concerns and signify indications as to how to build better EHR systems that meet provider needs.</p> <p>To understand why primary care practitioners (PCPs) use workarounds to manage test results by analyzing data from a previously conducted national cross-sectional survey on test result management.</p> <p>We conducted a secondary data analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from a national survey of PCPs practicing in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and explored the use of workarounds in test results management. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to examine the association between key sociotechnical factors that could affect test results follow-up (e.g., both technology-related and those unrelated to technology, such as organizational support for patient notification) and workaround use. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of free text survey data to examine reasons for use of workarounds.</p> <p>Of 2554 survey respondents, 1104 (43%) reported using workarounds related to test results management. Of these 1028 (93%) described the type of workaround they were using; 719 (70%) reported paper-based methods, while 230 (22%) used a combination of paper- and computer-based workarounds. Primary care practitioners who self-reported limited administrative support to help them notify patients of test results or described an instance where they personally (or a colleague) missed results, were more likely to use workarounds (p=0.02 and p=0.001, respectively). Qualitative analysis identified three main reasons for workaround use: 1) as a memory aid, 2) for improved efficiency and 3) for facilitating internal and external care coordination.</p> <p>Workarounds to manage EHR-based test results are common, and their use results from unmet provider information management needs. Future EHRs and the respective work systems around them need to evolve to meet these needs.</p>",

We sought to determine if HIE system usage is correlated with a reduction in admissions via the ED.</p> <p> <b>Methods:</b> We identified 15,645 adults from New York State with an ED visit during a 6-month period, all of whom consented to have their information accessible in the HIE system, and were continuously enrolled in two area health plans. Using claims we determined if the ED encounter resulted in an admission. We used the HIE’s system log files to determine usage during the encounter. We determined the association between HIE system use and the likelihood of admission to the hospital from the ED and potential cost savings.</p> <p> <b>Results:</b> The HIE system was accessed during 2.4% of encounters. The odds of an admission were 30% lower when the system was accessed after controlling for confounding (odds ratio = 0.70; 95%C I= 0.52, 0.95). The annual savings in the sample was $357,000.</p> <p> <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest that the use of an HIE system may reduce hospitalizations from the ED with resultant cost savings. This is an important outcome given the substantial financial investment in interventions designed to improve provider access to patient information in the US.</p> <p> <b>Citation:</b> Vest JR, Kern LM, Campion TR Jr, Silver MD, Kaushal R.

		"abstract": "Background Value-based payment for care requires the consistent, objective calculation of care quality. Previous initiatives to calculate ambulatory quality measures have relied on billing data or individual electronic health records (EHRs) to calculate and report performance. New methods for quality measure calculation promoted by federal regulations allow qualified clinical data registries to report quality outcomes based on data aggregated across facilities and EHRs using interoperability standards.\n\n  Objective This research evaluates the use of clinical document interchange standards as the basis for quality measurement.\n\n  Methods Using data on 1,100 patients from 11 ambulatory care facilities and 5 different EHRs, challenges to quality measurement are identified and addressed for 17 certified quality measures.\n\n  Results Iterative solutions were identified for 14 measures that improved patient inclusion and measure calculation accuracy. Findings validate this approach to improving measure accuracy while maintaining measure certification.\n\n  Conclusion Organizations that report care quality should be aware of how identified issues affect quality measure selection and calculation. Quality measure authors should consider increasing real-world validation and the consistency of measure logic in respect to issues identified in this research.",
