In 2021, one of the most thought-provoking articles highlighted the gap between the excitement surrounding AI in healthcare and the actual products that emerged. This divergence underscores a crucial lesson: the necessity of interdisciplinary development teams.

## Silos in Expertise

During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous AI tools were rapidly developed to assist with hospital diagnoses and patient care. However, many of these tools failed to deliver on their promises. The root of this issue lies in the isolated development processes. Tools were often created either by AI researchers without sufficient medical knowledge or by medical researchers lacking advanced mathematical and computational skills.

A key message from the article states:

> "Many tools were developed either by AI researchers who lacked the medical expertise to spot flaws in the data or by medical researchers who lacked the mathematical skills to compensate for those flaws."

This statement encapsulates the core problem: a lack of collaboration between disciplines leads to ineffective solutions.

## The Role of Interdisciplinary Teams

To overcome these challenges, it is essential to foster collaboration between AI researchers and medical professionals. Interdisciplinary teams can combine their strengths to address the shortcomings of each field. AI experts bring advanced machine learning techniques, while medical professionals provide critical insights into clinical relevance and data interpretation.

The future of AI in healthcare hinges on the effective collaboration between diverse fields of expertise. By integrating the knowledge of AI researchers and medical professionals, we can develop more reliable and impactful tools. This interdisciplinary approach is not just beneficial but essential for advancing medical technology and improving patient care.
