The digitalization of medicine is progressing and accelerating further due to the German Hospital Future Act (KHZG). As a community, we should not forget to evaluate the developed solutions, apps, and AI algorithms together with the users. This works excellently in cooperation with clinics and practices. From such a collaboration with mbits imaging, a paper has emerged that is now available as Open Access. In this paper, we examine the usability of a deep learning software in the operating room. At this point, I would like to extend my thanks once again to Hannah Syrek and Michael MÃ¼ller for the great collaboration!
