A seismic shift in Germany's Electronic Health Record (EHR) market is on the horizon.

A few months back, SAP announced they're discontinuing the 'Industry Solution for Healthcare' (IS-H), an adaptation of their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that provides patient administration and billing services. This sudden move was quite surprising and means many German hospitals will need to transition their primary EHR system in the upcoming years.

While I'm not personally involved in these discussions, I stumbled upon an enlightening [article](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/epic-denmark-health-1510223) from 2019 detailing the experiences of 18 Danish hospitals during their transition to the Epic EHR system. Although the article seems to disproportionately blame the vendor, it offers an insightful account of the challenges associated with migrating EHR systems across multiple hospitals simultaneously.

I can't help but consider it as a potential snapshot of what lies ahead for us in Germany...
