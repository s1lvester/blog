#PyCon and hashtag#PyData Berlin is over and we collectively have landed back in reality.

In retrospect I have mixed feelings about the conference. On the plus side I was lucky to meet with a diverse group of interesting people, especially during the social event. 🥳

Unfortunately the quality of the talks was very hit and miss. Here’s an incomplete list of the ones I would recommend checking out - as far as I know they will be slowly released on YouTube:

Marco Gorelli‘s talk on polars 🐻‍❄️ plugins: https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2024/talk/LNFSDV/

Charles Truong gave an interesting talk about „ruptures“ library for change-point detection data 📈 for timeseries analysis. https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2024/talk/ZKYA9W/

Katharine Jarmul gave a great talk on the problem of knowledge leakage 👩‍🔬from ML models. https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2024/talk/BFF9VA/

If your looking for a high-performance dataviz framework that is able to handle streaming data within milliseconds 📉 you should give a look to Tim Paine‘s talk on Perspective https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2024/talk/9JEZ8E/
